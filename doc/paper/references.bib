	abstract = {Whether SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccines confer exposure-dependent (“leaky”) protection against infection remains unknown. We examined the effect of prior infection, vaccination, and hybrid immunity on infection risk among residents of Connecticut correctional facilities during periods of predominant Omicron and Delta transmission. Residents with cell, cellblock, and no documented exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infected residents were matched by facility and date. During the Omicron period, prior infection, vaccination, and hybrid immunity reduced the infection risk of residents without a documented exposure (HR: 0.36 [0.25–0.54]; 0.57 [0.42–0.78]; 0.24 [0.15–0.39]; respectively) and with cellblock exposures (0.61 [0.49–0.75]; 0.69 [0.58–0.83]; 0.41 [0.31–0.55]; respectively) but not with cell exposures (0.89 [0.58–1.35]; 0.96 [0.64–1.46]; 0.80 [0.46–1.39]; respectively). Associations were similar during the Delta period and when analyses were restricted to tested residents. Although associations may not have been thoroughly adjusted due to dataset limitations, the findings suggest that prior infection and vaccination may be leaky, highlighting the potential benefits of pairing vaccination with non-pharmaceutical interventions in crowded settings.},

The aerosols were held in a rotating drum with the relative humidity at either the low (30 ± 5\%), medium (50 ± 5\%), or high (80 ± 5\%) level at 20 ± 1 °C. An all-glass impinger was used to recover the virus from the air in the drum, with the first air sample being collected after a 15-min period of aerosol stabilization. Subsequent air samples were withdrawn at 2, 4, 8, and 14 h after stabilization of the aerosol. At the low and medium relative humidity levels, the infectivity of the airborne virus was rapidly lost and less than 0.25\% could be detected in the first air sample. At the high RH level, however, the airborne virus had a half-life of 13.7 ± 1.91 h and nearly 30\% of the input infectious virus could be detected in the drum air even after 24 h of aerosolization. These findings suggest that under certain environmental conditions, notably high relative humidity, air may act as a vehicle for the spread of rhinovirus infections.},

Since these reviews were published, several new studies have been done and generated new data. These include direct demonstration of the presence of influenza viruses in aerosolized droplets from the tidal breathing of infected persons and in the air of an emergency department; the establishment of the guinea pig model for influenza transmission, where it was shown that aerosol transmission is important and probably modulated by temperature and humidity; the demonstration of some genetic determinants of airborne transmission of influenza viruses as assessed using the ferret model; and mathematical modelling studies that strongly support the aerosol route.

	volume = {5},
	doi = {10.1128/msphere.00441-20},
	abstract = {Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first identified in China in late 2019 and is caused by newly identified severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Previous studies had reported the stability of SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture media and deposited onto surfaces under a limited set of environmental conditions. Here, we broadly investigated the effects of relative humidity, temperature, and droplet size on the stability of SARS-CoV-2 in a simulated clinically relevant matrix dried on nonporous surfaces. The results show that SARS-CoV-2 decayed more rapidly when either humidity or temperature was increased but that droplet volume (1 to 50 μl) and surface type (stainless steel, plastic, or nitrile glove) did not significantly impact decay rate. At room temperature (24°C), virus half-life ranged from 6.3 to 18.6 h depending on the relative humidity but was reduced to 1.0 to 8.9 h when the temperature was increased to 35°C. These findings suggest that a potential for fomite transmission may persist for hours to days in indoor environments and have implications for assessment of the risk posed by surface contamination in indoor environments.
IMPORTANCE Mitigating the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in clinical settings and public spaces is critically important to reduce the number of COVID-19 cases while effective vaccines and therapeutics are under development. SARS-CoV-2 transmission is thought to primarily occur through direct person-to-person transfer of infectious respiratory droplets or through aerosol-generating medical procedures. However, contact with contaminated surfaces may also play a significant role. In this context, understanding the factors contributing to SARS-CoV-2 persistence on surfaces will enable a more accurate estimation of the risk of contact transmission and inform mitigation strategies. To this end, we have developed a simple mathematical model that can be used to estimate virus decay on nonporous surfaces under a range of conditions and which may be utilized operationally to identify indoor environments in which the virus is most persistent.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT COVID-19 disease is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which originated in Wuhan, China and spread with an astonishing rate across the world. The transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2 are still debated, but recent evidence strongly suggests that COVID-19 could be transmitted via air in poorly ventilated places. Some studies also suggest the higher surface stability of SARS-CoV-2 as compared to SARS-CoV-1. It is also possible that small viral particles may enter into indoor environments from the various emission sources aided by environmental factors such as relative humidity, wind speed, temperature, thus representing a type of an aerosol transmission. Here, we explore the role of relative humidity in airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus in indoor environments based on recent studies around the world. Humidity affects both the evaporation kinematics and particle growth. In dry indoor places i.e., less humidity ({\textless} 40\% RH), the chances of airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 are higher than that of humid places (i.e., {\textgreater} 90\% RH). Based on earlier studies, a relative humidity of 40–60\% was found to be optimal for human health in indoor places. Thus, it is extremely important to set a minimum relative humidity standard for indoor environments such as hospitals, offices and public transports for minimization of airborne spread of SARS-CoV-2.},

Although the need for accurate and objective cough detection in ambulatory settings is widely acknowledged in the medical literature, little research has been done on automating the classification using a single microphone in an open, real-world setting. This study examined the feasibility of applying artificial intelligence to recognize and categorize coughs by patients wearing or not wearing masks in a waiting room of a primary care institution with a single microphone and varying degrees of background noise. A sequential convolutional neural network (CNN) consisting of two 2D convolutional layers with 3x3 kernels and four filters were used with varying parameters. The best performing classification model used three layers with 64, 32 and 16 filters. It achieved an overall accuracy of 98.5\% with a sensitivity of 98.2\% and specificity of 98.8\%. The findings imply that detection using artificial intelligence and a single microphone in a waiting room might be feasible to use in certain scenarios.},

In routine care, pediatricians often resort to clinical diagnoses, even in the absence of robust evidence-based criteria. We used a dual approach to identify clinical characteristics that may help to differentiate infections with common pathogens including influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, metapneumovirus, rhinovirus, bocavirus-1, coronaviruses, or parainfluenza virus: (a) systematic review and meta-analysis of 47 clinical studies published in Medline (June 1996 to March 2017, PROSPERO registration number: CRD42017059557) comprising 49 858 individuals and (b) data-driven analysis of an inception cohort of 6073 children with ILI (aged 0-18 years, 56\% male, December 2009 to March 2015) examined at the point of care in addition to blinded PCR testing. We determined pooled odds ratios for the literature analysis and compared these to odds ratios based on the clinical cohort dataset. This combined analysis suggested significant associations between influenza and fever or headache, as well as between respiratory syncytial virus infection and cough, dyspnea, and wheezing. Similarly, literature and cohort data agreed on significant associations between HMPV infection and cough, as well as adenovirus infection and fever. Importantly, none of the abovementioned features were unique to any particular pathogen but were also observed in association with other respiratory viruses. In summary, our “real-world” dataset confirmed published literature trends, but no individual feature allows any particular type of viral infection to be ruled in or ruled out. For the time being, laboratory confirmation remains essential. More research is needed to develop scientifically validated decision models to inform best practice guidelines and targeted diagnostic algorithms.},

	abstract = {The respiratory epithelium constitutes the first line of defense against invading respiratory pathogens, such as the 2009 pandemic strain of influenza A virus (IAV, H1N1pdm09), and plays a crucial role in the host antiviral response to infection. Despite its importance, however, it remains unknown how individual cell types within the respiratory epithelium respond to IAV infection or how the latter may influence IAV disease progression and pathogenesis. Here, we used single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to dissect the host response to IAV infection in its natural target cells. scRNA-seq was performed on human airway epithelial cell (hAEC) cultures infected with either wild-type pandemic IAV (WT) or with a mutant version of IAV (NS1R38A) that induced a robust innate immune response. We then characterized both the host and viral transcriptomes of more than 19,000 single cells across the 5 major cell types populating the human respiratory epithelium. For all cell types, we observed a wide spectrum of viral burden among single infected cells and a disparate host response between infected and bystander populations. Interestingly, we also identified multiple key differences in the host response to IAV among individual cell types, including high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in secretory and basal cells and an important role for luminal cells in sensing and restricting incoming virus. Multiple infected cell types were shown to upregulate interferons (IFN), with type III IFNs clearly dominating the antiviral response. Transcriptional changes in genes related to cell differentiation, cell migration, and tissue repair were also identified. Strikingly, we also detected a shift in viral host cell tropism from non-ciliated cells to ciliated cells at later stages of infection and observed major changes in the cellular composition. Microscopic analysis of both WT and NS1R38A virus-infected hAECs at various stages of IAV infection revealed that the transcriptional changes we observed at 18 hpi were likely driving the downstream histopathological alterations in the airway epithelium. To our knowledge, this is the first study to provide a comprehensive analysis of the cell type-specific host antiviral response to influenza virus infection in its natural target cells – namely, the human respiratory epithelium.},

	abstract = {Background The current understanding of airborne tuberculosis (TB) transmission is based on classic 1950s studies in which guinea pigs were exposed to air from a tuberculosis ward. Recently we recreated this model in Lima, Perú, and in this paper we report the use of molecular fingerprinting to investigate patient infectiousness in the current era of HIV infection and multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB. Methods and Findings All air from a mechanically ventilated negative-pressure HIV-TB ward was exhausted over guinea pigs housed in an airborne transmission study facility on the roof. Animals had monthly tuberculin skin tests, and positive reactors were removed for autopsy and organ culture for M. tuberculosis. Temporal exposure patterns, drug susceptibility testing, and DNA fingerprinting of patient and animal TB strains defined infectious TB patients. Relative patient infectiousness was calculated using the Wells-Riley model of airborne infection. Over 505 study days there were 118 ward admissions of 97 HIV-positive pulmonary TB patients. Of 292 exposed guinea pigs, 144 had evidence of TB disease; a further 30 were tuberculin skin test positive only. There was marked variability in patient infectiousness; only 8.5\% of 118 ward admissions by TB patients were shown by DNA fingerprinting to have caused 98\% of the 125 characterised cases of secondary animal TB. 90\% of TB transmission occurred from inadequately treated MDR TB patients. Three highly infectious MDR TB patients produced 226, 52, and 40 airborne infectious units (quanta) per hour. Conclusions A small number of inadequately treated MDR TB patients coinfected with HIV were responsible for almost all TB transmission, and some patients were highly infectious. This result highlights the importance of rapid TB drug-susceptibility testing to allow prompt initiation of effective treatment, and environmental control measures to reduce ongoing TB transmission in crowded health care settings. TB infection control must be prioritized in order to prevent health care facilities from disseminating the drug-resistant TB that they are attempting to treat.},

	abstract = {The CDC recommends that healthcare settings provide influenza patients with facemasks as a means of reducing transmission to staff and other patients, and a recent report suggested that surgical masks can capture influenza virus in large droplet spray. However, there is minimal data on influenza virus aerosol shedding, the infectiousness of exhaled aerosols, and none on the impact of facemasks on viral aerosol shedding from patients with seasonal influenza. We collected samples of exhaled particles (one with and one without a facemask) in two size fractions (“coarse”{\textgreater}5 µm, “fine”≤5 µm) from 37 volunteers within 5 days of seasonal influenza onset, measured viral copy number using quantitative RT-PCR, and tested the fine-particle fraction for culturable virus. Fine particles contained 8.8 (95\% CI 4.1 to 19) fold more viral copies than did coarse particles. Surgical masks reduced viral copy numbers in the fine fraction by 2.8 fold (95\% CI 1.5 to 5.2) and in the coarse fraction by 25 fold (95\% CI 3.5 to 180). Overall, masks produced a 3.4 fold (95\% CI 1.8 to 6.3) reduction in viral aerosol shedding. Correlations between nasopharyngeal swab and the aerosol fraction copy numbers were weak (r = 0.17, coarse; r = 0.29, fine fraction). Copy numbers in exhaled breath declined rapidly with day after onset of illness. Two subjects with the highest copy numbers gave culture positive fine particle samples. Surgical masks worn by patients reduce aerosols shedding of virus. The abundance of viral copies in fine particle aerosols and evidence for their infectiousness suggests an important role in seasonal influenza transmission. Monitoring exhaled virus aerosols will be important for validation of experimental transmission studies in humans.},

Aim We investigated global M. pneumoniae incidence after implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) against COVID-19 in March 2020. Methods We surveyed M. pneumoniae detections from laboratories and surveillance systems (national or regional) across the world from 1 April 2020 to 31 March 2021 and compared them with cases from corresponding months between 2017 and 2020. Macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae (MRMp) data were collected from 1 April 2017 to 31 March 2021. Results Thirty-seven sites from 21 countries in Europe, Asia, America and Oceania submitted valid datasets (631,104 tests). Among the 30,617 M. pneumoniae detections, 62.39\% were based on direct test methods (predominantly PCR), 34.24\% on a combination of PCR and serology (no distinction between methods) and 3.37\% on serology alone (only IgM considered). In all countries, M. pneumoniae incidence by direct test methods declined significantly after implementation of NPIs with a mean of 1.69\% (SD ± 3.30) compared with 8.61\% (SD ± 10.62) in previous years (p \&lt; 0.01). Detection rates decreased with direct but not with indirect test methods (serology) (–93.51\% vs + 18.08\%; p \&lt; 0.01). Direct detections remained low worldwide throughout April 2020 to March 2021 despite widely differing lockdown or school closure periods. Seven sites (Europe, Asia and America) reported MRMp detections in one of 22 investigated cases in April 2020 to March 2021 and 176 of 762 (23.10\%) in previous years (p = 0.04). Conclusions This comprehensive collection of M. pneumoniae detections worldwide shows correlation between COVID-19 NPIs and significantly reduced detection numbers.},

We investigated detection of airborne rhinovirus in office environments by polymerase chain reaction technology and related detection to outdoor air supply rates.

We directly extracted RNA from the filters for nested reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction analysis of rhinovirus. Nasal lavage samples from building occupants with upper respiratory infections were also collected. Indoor carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations were recorded every 10 minutes as a surrogate for outdoor air supply. To increase the range of CO2 concentrations, we adjusted the outdoor air supply rates every 3 months. Generalized additive models demonstrated an association between the probability of detecting airborne rhinovirus and a weekly average CO2 concentration greater than approximately 100 ppm, after controlling for covariates. In addition, one rhinovirus from a nasal lavage contained an identical nucleic acid sequence similar to that in the building air collected during the same week. These results suggest that occupants in buildings with low outdoor air supply may have an increased risk of exposure to infectious droplet nuclei emanating from a fellow building occupant.},

Since bioaerosols are very diverse in terms of their sizes, species, biological properties, and requirements for their detection and quantification, bioaerosol sampling is an active, yet challenging research area. This article was inspired by the discussions during the 2018 International Aerosol Conference (IAC) (St. Louis, MO, USA) regarding the need to summarize the current state of the art in bioaerosol research, including bioaerosol sampling, and the need to develop a more standardized set of guidelines for protocols used in bioaerosol research. The article is a combination of literature review and perspectives: it discusses the main bioaerosol sampling techniques and then overviews the latest technical developments in each area; the overview is followed by the discussion of the emerging trends and developments in the field, including personal sampling, application of passive samplers, and advances toward improving bioaerosol detection limits as well as the emerging challenges such as collection of viruses and collection of unbiased samples for bioaerosol sequencing. The article also discusses some of the practical aspects of bioaerosol sampling with particular focus on sampling aspects that could lead to bioaerosol determination bias.

	abstract = {The dynamics and significance of aerosol transmission of respiratory viruses are still controversial, for the major reasons that virus aerosols are inefficiently collected by commonly used air samplers and that the collected viruses are inactivated by the collection method. Without knowledge of virus viability, infection risk analyses lack accuracy. This pilot study was performed to (i) determine whether infectious (viable) respiratory viruses in aerosols could be collected from air in a real world environment by the viable virus aerosol sampler (VIVAS), (ii) compare and contrast the efficacy of the standard bioaerosol sampler, the BioSampler, with that of the VIVAS for the collection of airborne viruses in a real world environment, and (iii) gain insights for the use of the VIVAS for respiratory virus sampling. The VIVAS operates via a water vapor condensation process to enlarge aerosolized virus particles to facilitate their capture. A variety of viable human respiratory viruses, including influenza A H1N1 and H3N2 viruses and influenza B viruses, were collected by the VIVAS located at least 2 m from seated patients, during a late-onset 2016 influenza virus outbreak. Whereas the BioSampler when operated following our optimized parameters also collected virus aerosols, it was nevertheless overall less successful based on a lower frequency of virus isolation in most cases. This side-by-side comparison highlights some limitations of past studies based on impingement-based sampling, which may have generated false-negative results due to either poor collection efficiency and/or virus inactivation due to the collection process.
IMPORTANCE The significance of virus aerosols in the natural transmission of respiratory diseases has been a contentious issue, primarily because it is difficult to collect or sample virus aerosols using currently available air sampling devices. We tested a new air sampler based on water vapor condensation for efficient sampling of viable airborne respiratory viruses in a student health care center as a model of a real world environment. The new sampler outperformed the industry standard device (the SKC BioSampler) in the collection of natural virus aerosols and in maintaining virus viability. These results using the VIVAS indicate that respiratory virus aerosols are more prevalent and potentially pose a greater inhalation biohazard than previously thought. The VIVAS thus appears to be a useful apparatus for microbiology air quality tests related to the detection of viable airborne viruses.},

Considerable controversy exists with regard to whether influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are spread by the inhalation of infectious airborne particles and about the importance of this route, compared with droplet or contact transmission.Methods. Airborne particles were collected in an urgent care clinic with use of stationary and personal aerosol samplers. The amounts of airborne influenza A, influenza B, and RSV RNA were determined using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Health care workers and patients participating in the study were tested for influenza.Results. Seventeen percent of the stationary samplers contained influenza A RNA, 1\% contained influenza B RNA, and 32\% contained RSV RNA. Nineteen percent of the personal samplers contained influenza A RNA, none contained influenza B RNA, and 38\% contained RSV RNA. The number of samplers containing influenza RNA correlated well with the number and location of patients with influenza (r=0.77). Forty-two percent of the influenza A RNA was in particles ⩽4.1 µm in aerodynamic diameter, and 9\% of the RSV RNA was in particles ⩽4.1 µm.Conclusions. Airborne particles containing influenza and RSV RNA were detected throughout a health care facility. The particles were small enough to remain airborne for an extended time and to be inhaled deeply into the respiratory tract. These results support the possibility that influenza and RSV can be transmitted by the airborne route and suggest that further investigation of the potential of these particles to transmit infection is warranted.},

	abstract = {Background: Exhaled breath studies suggest that humans exhale fine particles during tidal breathing, but little is known of their physical origin in the respiratory system during health or disease.

Methods: Particles generated by 3 healthy and 16 human rhinovirus (HRV)-infected subjects were counted using an optical particle counter with nominal diameter-size bins ranging between 0.3 and 10 μm. Data were collected from HRV-infected subjects during tidal breathing. In addition, data from healthy subjects were collected during coughs, swallows, tidal breathing, and breathing to total lung capacity (TLC) and residual volume (RV). Using general additive models, we graphed exhaled particle concentration versus airflow during exhalation. Exhaled particles were collected from expired air on gelatin filters and analyzed for HRV via quantitative PCR.

Results: HRV-infected subjects exhaled from 0.1 to 7200 particles per liter of exhaled air during tidal breathing (geometric mean = 32 part/L). A small fraction (24\%) of subjects exhaled most (81\%) of the particles measured and 82\% of particles detected were 0.300–0.499 μm. Minute ventilation, maximum airflow during exhalation, and forced expiratory volume 1 second (FEV1 \% predicted) were positively correlated with particle production. No human rhinovirus was detected in exhaled breath samples. Three healthy subjects exhaled less than 100 particles per liter of exhaled air during tidal breathing and increased particle concentrations more with exhalation to RV than with coughing, swallowing, or rapid exhalation.

Conclusions: Submicron particles were detected in the exhaled breath of healthy and HRV-infected subjects. Particle concentrations were correlated with airflow during the first half of exhalation, and peaked at the end of exhalation, indicating both lower and upper airways as particle sources. The effect of breathing maneuver suggested a major contribution from lower airways, probably the result of opening collapsed small airways and alveoli.},

	abstract = {The ongoing outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly on a global scale. Although it is clear that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is transmitted through human respiratory droplets and direct contact, the potential for aerosol transmission is poorly understood1–3. Here we investigated the aerodynamic nature of SARS-CoV-2 by measuring viral RNA in aerosols in different areas of two Wuhan hospitals during the outbreak of COVID-19 in February and March 2020. The concentration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in aerosols that was detected in isolation wards and ventilated patient rooms was very low, but it was higher in the toilet areas used by the patients. Levels of airborne SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the most public areas was undetectable, except in two areas that were prone to crowding; this increase was possibly due to individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the crowd. We found that some medical staff areas initially had high concentrations of viral RNA with aerosol size distributions that showed peaks in the submicrometre and/or supermicrometre regions; however, these levels were reduced to undetectable levels after implementation of rigorous sanitization procedures. Although we have not established the infectivity of the virus detected in these hospital areas, we propose that SARS-CoV-2 may have the potential to be transmitted through aerosols. Our results indicate that room ventilation, open space, sanitization of protective apparel, and proper use and disinfection of toilet areas can effectively limit the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in aerosols. Future work should explore the infectivity of aerosolized virus.},

	abstract = {Background. Defining dispersal of influenza virus via aerosol is essential for the development of prevention measures.Methods. During the 2010–2011 influenza season, subjects with influenza-like illness were enrolled in an emergency department and throughout a tertiary care hospital, nasopharyngeal swab specimens were obtained, and symptom severity, treatment, and medical history were recorded. Quantitative impaction air samples were taken not ≤0.305 m (1 foot), 0.914 m (3 feet), and 1.829 m (6 feet) from the patient's head during routine care. Influenza virus was detected by rapid test and polymerase chain reaction.Results. Sixty-one of 94 subjects (65\%) tested positive for influenza virus. Twenty-six patients (43\%) released influenza virus into room air, with 5 (19\%) emitting up to 32 times more virus than others. Emitters surpassed the airborne 50\% human infectious dose of influenza virus at all sample locations. Healthcare professionals (HCPs) were exposed to mainly small influenza virus particles (diameter, \&lt;4.7 µm), with concentrations decreasing with increasing distance from the patient's head (P \&lt; .05). Influenza virus release was associated with high viral loads in nasopharyngeal samples (shedding), coughing, and sneezing (P \&lt; .05). Patients who reported severe illness and major interference with daily life also emitted more influenza virus (P \&lt; .05).Conclusions. HCPs within 1.829 m of patients with influenza could be exposed to infectious doses of influenza virus, primarily in small-particle aerosols. This finding questions the current paradigm of localized droplet transmission during non–aerosol-generating procedures.},

	abstract = {The current revival of the American economy is being predicated on social distancing, specifically the Six-Foot Rule, a guideline that offers little protection from pathogen-bearing aerosol droplets sufficiently small to be continuously mixed through an indoor space. The importance of airborne transmission of COVID-19 is now widely recognized. While tools for risk assessment have recently been developed, no safety guideline has been proposed to protect against it. We here build on models of airborne disease transmission in order to derive an indoor safety guideline that would impose an upper bound on the “cumulative exposure time,” the product of the number of occupants and their time in an enclosed space. We demonstrate how this bound depends on the rates of ventilation and air filtration, dimensions of the room, breathing rate, respiratory activity and face mask use of its occupants, and infectiousness of the respiratory aerosols. By synthesizing available data from the best-characterized indoor spreading events with respiratory drop size distributions, we estimate an infectious dose on the order of 10 aerosol-borne virions. The new virus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) is thus inferred to be an order of magnitude more infectious than its forerunner (SARS-CoV), consistent with the pandemic status achieved by COVID-19. Case studies are presented for classrooms and nursing homes, and a spreadsheet and online app are provided to facilitate use of our guideline. Implications for contact tracing and quarantining are considered, and appropriate caveats enumerated. Particular consideration is given to respiratory jets, which may substantially elevate risk when face masks are not worn.},

	abstract = {In this paper, the statistical distributions of the position and the size of the evaporating droplets after a cough are evaluated, thus characterizing the inherent stochasticity of respiratory releases due to turbulence. For that, ten independent realizations of a cough with realistic initial conditions and in a room at 20 °C and 40\% relative humidity were performed with large eddy simulations and Lagrangian tracking of the liquid phase. It was found that although turbulence decreases far from the emitter, it results in large variations in the spatial distribution of the droplets. The total suspended liquid mass after 60 s from the cough is in good agreement with that estimated by a one-dimensional model accounting for settling and evaporation under quiescent conditions, while deposition times of droplets in the 10–100 μm range are found to vary significantly, reflected in the mass of liquid, and hence the virus content, potentially inhaled by a receptor. The high variability between events is due to the local fluctuations of temperature, humidity, and velocity on droplet evaporation and motion. The droplet distribution suggests that, in the absence of face coverings, an unprotected cough is not safe at 2 m away from the emitter even outdoors. The results indicate that mitigation measures, such as ventilation to address long-range transmission, can be based on the total suspended liquid content evaluated from reduced-order models. However, the large variability of viral content in the near field produces wide variations in estimates of risk; therefore, a stochastic approach is needed for evaluating short-range transmission risk.},

While masks are known to substantially reduce disease transmission in healthcare settings [D. K. Chu et al., Lancet 395, 1973–1987 (2020); J. Howard et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 118, e2014564118 (2021); Y. Cheng et al., Science eabg6296 (2021)], studies in community settings report inconsistent results [H. M. Ollila et al., medRxiv (2020); J.

Most such studies focus on how masks impact transmission, by analyzing how effective government mask mandates are. However, we find that widespread voluntary mask wearing, and other data limitations, make mandate effectiveness a poor proxy for mask-wearing effectiveness. We directly analyze the effect of mask wearing on SARS-CoV-2 transmission, drawing on several datasets covering 92 regions on six continents, including the largest survey of wearing behavior (��=

Using a Bayesian hierarchical model, we estimate the effect of mask wearing on transmission, by linking reported wearing levels to reported cases in each region, while adjusting for mobility and nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), such as bans on large gatherings. Our estimates imply that the mean observed level of mask wearing corresponds to a 19\% decrease in the reproduction number R. We also assess the robustness of our results in 60 tests spanning 20 sensitivity analyses. In light of these results, policy makers can effectively reduce transmission by intervening to increase mask wearing.},

There is mounting evidence that it can also be transmitted by inhalation of infected saliva aerosol particles. These particles are generated when breathing, talking, laughing, coughing or sneezing. It can be assumed that aerosol particle concentrations should be kept low in order to minimize the potential risk of airborne virus transmission. This paper presents measurements of aerosol particle concentrations in a gym, where saliva aerosol production is pronounced. 35 test persons performed physical exercise and aerosol particle concentrations, CO2 concentrations, air temperature and relative humidity were obtained in the room of 886 m³. A separate test was used to discriminate between human endogenous and exogenous aerosol particles. Aerosol particle removal by mechanical ventilation and mobile air cleaning units was measured. The gym test showed that ventilation with air-change rate ACH = 2.2 h−1, i.e. 4.5 times the minimum of the Dutch Building Code, was insufficient to stop the significant aerosol concentration rise over 30 min. Air cleaning alone with ACH = 1.39 h−1 had a similar effect as ventilation alone. Simplified mathematical models were engaged to provide further insight into ventilation, air cleaning and deposition. It was shown that combining the above-mentioned ventilation and air cleaning can reduce aerosol particle concentrations with 80 to 90\% , depending on aerosol size. This combination of existing ventilation supplemented with air cleaning is energy efficient and can also be applied for other indoor environments.},

	abstract = {Exposure to particulate matter (PM) in school environments has been associated with respiratory illnesses among children. Although using air cleaners was reported to reduce PM exposure and improve residents' health in homes, their effects in classrooms are not well understood. We examined how the use of air cleaners in classrooms and school/classroom characteristics affect the levels of indoor PM. Our environmental study included 102 classrooms from 34 elementary schools located on the mainland peninsula and an island in Korea. Indoor and outdoor PM were monitored simultaneously with portable aerosol spectrometers, and indoor gravimetric PM levels were measured with low volume, size-selective samplers during the class hours. Correlations among PM measurements were computed and final multiple regression models for indoor PM were constructed with a model building procedure. Correlation between indoor and outdoor PM2.5 (PM {\textless} 2.5  μm in aerodynamic diameter) was higher (r = 0.78, p {\textless} 0.01) than that of PM10 (PM {\textless} 10  μm) (r = 0.49, p {\textless} 0.01). School location, classroom occupant density, and ambient PM levels significantly (p-values{\textless}0.05) affected classroom PM concentrations. The adjusted PM levels in classrooms using air cleaners were significantly (p-values{\textless}0.01) lower by approximately 35\% than in classrooms not using them. However, air cleaners appeared to remove PM2.5 more effectively than PM10, perhaps because coarse particles settle more rapidly than fine particles on surfaces, or their resuspension and generation rate by occupants exceeds the removal rate by air cleaners. Our study suggests that routine cleaning to remove surface dust along with the use of air cleaners might be required to effectively reduce occupants’ exposure in classrooms.},

	abstract = {Objectives
To evaluate the mechanical ventilation rates of dental treatment rooms and assess the effectiveness of aerosol removal by mechanical ventilation and a portable air cleaner (PAC) with a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter.
Methods
Volumetric airflow were measured to assess air change rate per hour by ventilation (ACHvent). Equivalent ventilation provided by the PAC (ACHpac) was calculated based on its clean air delivery rate. Concentrations of 0.3, 0.5 and 1.0 μm aerosol particles were measured in 10 dental treatment rooms with various ventilation rates at baseline, after 5-min of incense burn, and after 30-min of observation with and without the PAC or ventilation system in operation. Velocities of aerosol removal were assessed by concentration decay constants for the 0.3 μm particles with ventilation alone (Kn) and with ventilation and PAC (Kn+pac), and by times needed to reach 95 \% and 100 \% removal of accumulated aerosol particles.
Results
ACHvent varied from 3 to 45. Kn and Kn+pac were correlated with ACHvent (r = 0.90) and combined ACHtotal (r = 0.81), respectively. Accumulated aerosol particles could not be removed by ventilation alone within 30-min in rooms with ACHvent{\textless}15. PAC reduced aerosol accumulation and accelerated aerosol removal, and accumulated aerosols could be completely removed in 4 to 12-min by ventilation combined with PAC. Effectiveness of the PAC was especially prominent in rooms with poor ventilation. Added benefit of PAC in aerosol removal was inversely correlated with ACHvent.
Conclusions
Aerosol accumulation may occur in dental treatment rooms with poor ventilation. Addition of PAC with a HEPA filter significantly reduced aerosol accumulation and accelerated aerosol removal.
Clinical significance
Addition of PAC with a HEPA filter improves aerosol removal in rooms with low ventilation rates.},

	abstract = {The airborne transmission in indoor environments represents the main pathway of respiratory pathogens, and most of the indoor environments do not have adequate ventilation to contain the risk of infection. This is particularly relevant for gathering spaces such as restaurants, schools, offices, etc. due to the long exposure times and high crowding levels. In this paper we investigated the effectiveness of a novel patented personal air cleaner in reducing the airborne transmission of respiratory pathogens both in close proximity (considering a typical face-to-face configuration at a conversational distance) and in shared indoor environments despite maintaining distancing (lecture room). The effectiveness of the portable protection device was investigated using complex transient 3D Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) numerical simulations. The mathematical model employed, validated through experimental measurements, is based on a Eulerian-Lagrangian approach, describing the air flow as the continuous phase and infectious respiratory particles as the discrete phase. The CFD analyses revealed that the air cleaner could strongly reduce the inhalation of respiratory pathogens in both the investigated scenarios. The air cleaner effectiveness in the case of a close proximity scenario, expressed as relative reduction of volume of infectious respiratory particles inhaled by the exposed subject, resulted {\textgreater}92\%. In the case of use in a shared indoor environment, instead, during a 2-h lesson, the relative reduction of volume concentration of infectious particles in the breathing zone of the exposed subject was {\textgreater}99\%.},

The transmission of aerosols from a single patient room into corridors and a nurses’ station in the ward was measured. The rate of clearance of aerosols was measured over time from the patient room, nurses’ station and ward corridors with and without air cleaners [ie, portable high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters].Results:Aerosols rapidly travelled from the patient room into other parts of the ward. Air cleaners were effective in increasing the clearance of aerosols from the air in clinical spaces and reducing their spread to other areas. With 2 small domestic air cleaners in a single patient room of a hospital ward, 99\% of aerosols could be cleared within 5.5 minutes.Conclusions:Air cleaners may be useful in clinical spaces to help reduce the risk of acquisition of respiratory viruses that are transmitted via aerosols. They are easy to deploy and are likely to be cost-effective in a variety of healthcare settings.},

	abstract = {Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has infected many people worldwide. As the probability of being infected by the virus increases with an increase in the number of people gathered in an indoor space, methods for reducing its spread indoors are urgently required. In this study, a classroom with 25 students was considered as an indoor space, and an attempt was made to devise a method to reduce the concentration of the viruses generated indoors more effectively. Through numerical analysis, the age of air inside the classroom was compared and analyzed when both the air cleaner and natural ventilation were used. The age of air varied locally in the classroom depending on the position of the air cleaner, confirming its importance in effectively removing particles possibly containing viruses generated indoors. When the air cleaner flow rate was doubled, the age of air was almost halved, implying that the concentration of the particles including viruses generated indoors can be reduced efficiently by increasing the air cleaner flow rate. Natural ventilation performed by completely opening the windows and doors of the classroom reduced the age of air. It was observed that the operation of the air cleaner along with open windows and doors of the classroom reduced the concentration of the particles including viruses generated indoors more effectively. More specifically, when both natural ventilation and air cleaner were applied, the age of air decreased by almost 50\% compared with the only air cleaner case and by about 22\% compared with the only natural ventilation case.Copyright © 2021 American Association for Aerosol Research},

However, does breathing polluted air over many years affect the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection or severity of COVID-19 disease, and how intense are these effects? As climate change intensifies, air pollutant levels may rise, which might further affect the burden of respiratory viral diseases. We assessed the effect of increasing exposure to PM2.5 (particulate matter ≤ 2.5 microns in diameter) on SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility or COVID-19 severity and projected the impact on infections and hospitalisations over two years. Simulations in a hypothetical, representative population show that if exposure affects severity, then hospital admissions are projected to increase by 5–10\% for a one-unit exposure increase. However, if exposure affects susceptibility, then infections would increase with the potential for onward transmission and hospital admissions could increase by over 60\%. Implications of this study highlight the importance of considering this potential additional health and health system burden as part of strategic planning to mitigate and respond to changing air pollution levels. It is also important to better understand at which point PM2.5 exposure affects SARS-CoV-2 infection through to COVID-19 disease progression, to enable improved protection and better support of those most vulnerable.},

	abstract = {Objectives To investigate the association between long-term exposure to airborne pollutants and the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 up to March 2021 in a prospective study of residents in Varese city.
Methods Citizens of Varese aged ≥18 years as of 31 December 2019 were linked by residential address to 2018 average annual exposure to outdoor concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, NO2, NO and ozone modelled using the Flexible Air quality Regional Model (FARM) chemical transport model. Citizens were further linked to regional datasets for COVID-19 case ascertainment (positive nasopharyngeal swab specimens) and to define age, sex, living in a residential care home, population density and comorbidities. We estimated rate ratios and additional numbers of cases per 1 µg/m3 increase in air pollutants from single- and bi-pollutant Poisson regression models.
Results The 62 848 residents generated 4408 cases. Yearly average PM2.5 exposure was 12.5 µg/m3. Age, living in a residential care home, history of stroke and medications for diabetes, hypertension and obstructive airway diseases were independently associated with COVID-19. In single-pollutant multivariate models, PM2.5 was associated with a 5.1\% increase in the rate of COVID-19 (95\% CI 2.7\% to 7.5\%), corresponding to 294 additional cases per 100 000 person-years. The association was confirmed in bi-pollutant models; excluding subjects in residential care homes; and further adjusting for area-based indicators of socioeconomic level and use of public transportation. Similar findings were observed for PM10, NO2 and NO. Ozone was associated with a 2\% decrease in disease rate, the association being reversed in bi-pollutant models.
Conclusions Long-term exposure to low levels of air pollutants, especially PM2.5, increased the incidence of COVID-19. The causality warrants confirmation in future studies; meanwhile, government efforts to further reduce air pollution should continue.},

	abstract = {Lombardy, the most populated and industrialized Italian region, was the epicentre of the first wave (March and April 2020) of COVID-19 in Italy and it is among the most air polluted areas of Europe. We carried out an ecological study to assess the association between long-term exposure to particulate matter (PM) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) on COVID-19 incidence and all-cause mortality after accounting for demographic, socioeconomic and meteorological variables. The study was based on publicly available data. Multivariable negative binomial mixed regression models were fitted, and results were reported in terms of incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and standardized mortality ratios (SMR). The effect of winter temperature and humidity was modelled through restricted cubic spline. Data from 1439 municipalities out of 1507 (95\%) were included in the analyses, leading to a total of 61,377 COVID-19 cases and 40,401 deaths from all-causes collected from February 20th to April 16th and from March 1st to April 30th, 2020, respectively. Several demographic and socioeconomic variables resulted significantly associated with COVID-19 incidence and all-cause mortality in a multivariable fashion. An increase in average winter temperature was associated with a nonlinear decrease in COVID-19 incidence and all-cause mortality, while an opposite trend emerged for the absolute humidity. An increase of 10 μg/m3 in the mean annual concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 over the previous years was associated with a 58\% and 34\% increase in COVID-19 incidence rate, respectively. Similarly, a 10 μg/m3 increase of annual mean PM2.5 concentration was associated with a 23\% increase in all-cause mortality. An inverse association was found between NO2 levels and COVID-19 incidence and all-cause mortality. Our ecological study showed that exposure to PM was significantly associated with the COVID-19 incidence and excess mortality during the first wave of the outbreak in Lombardy, Italy.},

	abstract = {In December 2019, a novel disease, coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), emerged in Wuhan, People’s Republic of China. COVID-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) presumed to have jumped species from another mammal to humans. This virus has caused a rapidly spreading global pandemic. To date, over 300,000 cases of COVID-19 have been reported in England and over 40,000 patients have died. While progress has been achieved in managing this disease, the factors in addition to age that affect the severity and mortality of COVID-19 have not been clearly identified. Recent studies of COVID-19 in several countries identified links between air pollution and death rates. Here, we explored potential links between major fossil fuel-related air pollutants and SARS-CoV-2 mortality in England. We compared current SARS-CoV-2 cases and deaths from public databases to both regional and subregional air pollution data monitored at multiple sites across England. After controlling for population density, age and median income, we show positive relationships between air pollutant concentrations, particularly nitrogen oxides, and COVID-19 mortality and infectivity. Using detailed UK Biobank data, we further show that PM2.5 was a major contributor to COVID-19 cases in England, as an increase of 1 m3 in the long-term average of PM2.5 was associated with a 12\% increase in COVID-19 cases. The relationship between air pollution and COVID-19 withstands variations in the temporal scale of assessments (single-year vs 5-year average) and remains significant after adjusting for socioeconomic, demographic and health-related variables. We conclude that a small increase in air pollution leads to a large increase in the COVID-19 infectivity and mortality rate in England. This study provides a framework to guide both health and emissions policies in countries affected by this pandemic.},

We fitted a log-normal distribution to pooled data and found the median incubation period to be 5·6 days (95\% CI 4·8–6·3) for adenovirus, 3·2 days (95\% CI 2·8–3·7) for human coronavirus, 4·0 days (95\% CI 3·6–4·4) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, 1·4 days (95\% CI 1·3–1·5) for influenza A, 0·6 days (95\% CI 0·5–0·6) for influenza B, 12·5 days (95\% CI 11·8–13·3) for measles, 2·6 days (95\% CI 2·1–3·1) for parainfluenza, 4·4 days (95\% CI 3·9–4·9) for respiratory syncytial virus, and 1·9 days (95\% CI 1·4–2·4) for rhinovirus. When using the incubation period, it is important to consider its full distribution: the right tail for quarantine policy, the central regions for likely times and sources of infection, and the full distribution for models used in pandemic planning.

	abstract = {Background Growing evidence suggests an important contribution of airborne transmission to the overall spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), in particular via smaller particles called aerosols. However, the contribution of school children to SARS-CoV-2 transmission remains uncertain. The aim of this study was to assess transmission of airborne respiratory infections and the association with infection control measures in schools using a multiple-measurement approach. Methods and findings We collected epidemiological (cases of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)), environmental (CO2, aerosol and particle concentrations), and molecular data (bioaerosol and saliva samples) over 7 weeks from January to March 2022 (Omicron wave) in 2 secondary schools (n = 90, average 18 students/classroom) in Switzerland. We analyzed changes in environmental and molecular characteristics between different study conditions (no intervention, mask wearing, air cleaners). Analyses of environmental changes were adjusted for different ventilation, the number of students in class, school and weekday effects. We modeled disease transmission using a semi-mechanistic Bayesian hierarchical model, adjusting for absent students and community transmission. Molecular analysis of saliva (21/262 positive) and airborne samples (10/130) detected SARS-CoV-2 throughout the study (weekly average viral concentration 0.6 copies/L) and occasionally other respiratory viruses. Overall daily average CO2 levels were 1,064 ± 232 ppm (± standard deviation). Daily average aerosol number concentrations without interventions were 177 ± 109 1/cm3 and decreased by 69\% (95\% CrI 42\% to 86\%) with mask mandates and 39\% (95\% CrI 4\% to 69\%) with air cleaners. Compared to no intervention, the transmission risk was lower with mask mandates (adjusted odds ratio 0.19, 95\% CrI 0.09 to 0.38) and comparable with air cleaners (1.00, 95\% CrI 0.15 to 6.51). Study limitations include possible confounding by period as the number of susceptible students declined over time. Furthermore, airborne detection of pathogens document exposure but not necessarily transmission. Conclusions Molecular detection of airborne and human SARS-CoV-2 indicated sustained transmission in schools. Mask mandates were associated with greater reductions in aerosol concentrations than air cleaners and with lower transmission. Our multiple-measurement approach could be used to continuously monitor transmission risk of respiratory infections and the effectiveness of infection control measures in schools and other congregate settings.},

	abstract = {Airborne transmission is a recognized pathway of contagion; however, it is rarely quantitatively evaluated. The numerous outbreaks that have occurred during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic are putting a demand on researchers to develop approaches capable of both predicting contagion in closed environments (predictive assessment) and analyzing previous infections (retrospective assessment). This study presents a novel approach for quantitative assessment of the individual infection risk of susceptible subjects exposed in indoor microenvironments in the presence of an asymptomatic infected SARS-CoV-2 subject. The application of a Monte Carlo method allowed the risk for an exposed healthy subject to be evaluated or, starting from an acceptable risk, the maximum exposure time. We applied the proposed approach to four distinct scenarios for a prospective assessment, highlighting that, in order to guarantee an acceptable risk of 10−3 for exposed subjects in naturally ventilated indoor environments, the exposure time could be well below one hour. Such maximum exposure time clearly depends on the viral load emission of the infected subject and on the exposure conditions; thus, longer exposure times were estimated for mechanically ventilated indoor environments and lower viral load emissions. The proposed approach was used for retrospective assessment of documented outbreaks in a restaurant in Guangzhou (China) and at a choir rehearsal in Mount Vernon (USA), showing that, in both cases, the high attack rate values can be justified only assuming the airborne transmission as the main route of contagion. Moreover, we show that such outbreaks are not caused by the rare presence of a superspreader, but can be likely explained by the co-existence of conditions, including emission and exposure parameters, leading to a highly probable event, which can be defined as a “superspreading event”.},

In Switzerland, during the last weeks of December 2020, we established a nationwide screening protocol across multiple laboratories, focusing first on epidemiological and microbiological definitions. In January 2021, we validated and implemented an N501Y-specific PCR to rapidly screen for VoCs, which are then confirmed using amplicon sequencing or whole genome sequencing (WGS). A total of 13,387 VoCs have been identified since the detection of the first Swiss case in October 2020, with 4194 being B.1.1.7, 172 B.1.351, and 7 P.1. The remaining 9014 cases of VoCs have been described without further lineage specification. Overall, all diagnostic centers reported a rapid increase of the percentage of detected VOCs, with a range of 6 to 46\% between 25 to 31 of January 2021 increasing towards 41 to 82\% between 22 to 28 of February. A total of 739 N501Y positive genomes were analysed and show a broad range of introduction events to Switzerland. In this paper, we describe the nationwide coordination and implementation process across laboratories, public health institutions, and researchers, the first results of our N501Y-specific variant screening, and the phylogenetic analysis of all available WGS data in Switzerland, that together identified the early introduction events and subsequent community spreading of the VoCs.},

One method often used to place input variables on a common scale is to divide each numeric variable by its standard deviation. Here we propose dividing each numeric variable by two times its standard deviation, so that the generic comparison is with inputs equal to the mean ±1 standard deviation. The resulting coefﬁcients are then directly comparable for untransformed binary predictors. We have implemented the procedure as a function in R. We illustrate the method with two simple analyses that are typical of applied modeling: a linear regression of data from the National Election Study and a multilevel logistic regression of data on the prevalence of rodents in New York City apartments. We recommend our rescaling as a default option—an improvement upon the usual approach of including variables in whatever way they are coded in the data ﬁle—so that the magnitudes of coefﬁcients can be directly compared as a matter of routine statistical practice.

	abstract = {We propose a new prior distribution for classical (nonhierarchical) logistic regression models, constructed by first scaling all nonbinary variables to have mean 0 and standard deviation 0.5, and then placing independent Student-t prior distributions on the coefficients. As a default choice, we recommend the Cauchy distribution with center 0 and scale 2.5, which in the simplest setting is a longer-tailed version of the distribution attained by assuming one-half additional success and one-half additional failure in a logistic regression. Cross-validation on a corpus of datasets shows the Cauchy class of prior distributions to outperform existing implementations of Gaussian and Laplace priors. We recommend this prior distribution as a default choice for routine applied use. It has the advantage of always giving answers, even when there is complete separation in logistic regression (a common problem, even when the sample size is large and the number of predictors is small), and also automatically applying more shrinkage to higher-order interactions. This can be useful in routine data analysis as well as in automated procedures such as chained equations for missing-data imputation. We implement a procedure to fit generalized linear models in R with the Student-t prior distribution by incorporating an approximate EM algorithm into the usual iteratively weighted least squares. We illustrate with several applications, including a series of logistic regressions predicting voting preferences, a small bioassay experiment, and an imputation model for a public health data set.},

This paper reviews the use of CO2 as a “natural” tracer gas for estimating VRs, focusing on applications in school classrooms. It provides details and guidance for the steady-state, build-up, decay and transient mass balance methods. An extension to the build-up method and an analysis of the post-exercise recovery period that can increase CO2 generation rates are presented. Measurements in four mechanically-ventilated school buildings demonstrate the methods and highlight issues affecting their applicability. VRs during the school day fell below recommended minimum levels, and VRs during evening and early morning were on the order of 0.1 h−1, reflecting shutdown of the ventilation systems. The transient mass balance method was the most flexible and advantageous method given the low air change rates and dynamic occupancy patterns observed in the classrooms. While the extension to the build-up method improved stability and consistency, the accuracy of this and the steady-state method may be limited. Decay-based methods did not reflect the VR during the school day due to heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system shutdown. Since the number of occupants in classrooms changes over the day, the VR expressed on a per person basis (e.g., L·s−1·person−1) depends on the occupancy metric. If occupancy measurements can be obtained, then the transient mass balance method likely will provide the most consistent and accurate results among the CO2-based methods. Improved VR measurements can benefit many applications, including research examining the linkage between ventilation and health.},

	abstract = {Background Growing evidence suggests an important contribution of airborne transmission to the overall spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), in particular via smaller particles called aerosols. However, the contribution of school children to SARS-CoV-2 transmission remains uncertain. The aim of this study was to assess transmission of airborne respiratory infections and the association with infection control measures in schools using a multiple-measurement approach. Methods and findings We collected epidemiological (cases of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)), environmental (CO2, aerosol and particle concentrations), and molecular data (bioaerosol and saliva samples) over 7 weeks from January to March 2022 (Omicron wave) in 2 secondary schools (n = 90, average 18 students/classroom) in Switzerland. We analyzed changes in environmental and molecular characteristics between different study conditions (no intervention, mask wearing, air cleaners). Analyses of environmental changes were adjusted for different ventilation, the number of students in class, school and weekday effects. We modeled disease transmission using a semi-mechanistic Bayesian hierarchical model, adjusting for absent students and community transmission. Molecular analysis of saliva (21/262 positive) and airborne samples (10/130) detected SARS-CoV-2 throughout the study (weekly average viral concentration 0.6 copies/L) and occasionally other respiratory viruses. Overall daily average CO2 levels were 1,064 ± 232 ppm (± standard deviation). Daily average aerosol number concentrations without interventions were 177 ± 109 1/cm3 and decreased by 69\% (95\% CrI 42\% to 86\%) with mask mandates and 39\% (95\% CrI 4\% to 69\%) with air cleaners. Compared to no intervention, the transmission risk was lower with mask mandates (adjusted odds ratio 0.19, 95\% CrI 0.09 to 0.38) and comparable with air cleaners (1.00, 95\% CrI 0.15 to 6.51). Study limitations include possible confounding by period as the number of susceptible students declined over time. Furthermore, airborne detection of pathogens document exposure but not necessarily transmission. Conclusions Molecular detection of airborne and human SARS-CoV-2 indicated sustained transmission in schools. Mask mandates were associated with greater reductions in aerosol concentrations than air cleaners and with lower transmission. Our multiple-measurement approach could be used to continuously monitor transmission risk of respiratory infections and the effectiveness of infection control measures in schools and other congregate settings.},

	abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that avoids the random walk behavior and sensitivity to correlated parameters that plague many MCMC methods by taking a series of steps informed by ﬁrst-order gradient information. These features allow it to converge to high-dimensional target distributions much more quickly than simpler methods such as random walk Metropolis or Gibbs sampling. However, HMC’s performance is highly sensitive to two user-speciﬁed parameters: a step size and a desired number of steps L. In particular, if L is too small then the algorithm exhibits undesirable random walk behavior, while if L is too large the algorithm wastes computation. We introduce the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), an extension to HMC that eliminates the need to set a number of steps L. NUTS uses a recursive algorithm to build a set of likely candidate points that spans a wide swath of the target distribution, stopping automatically when it starts to double back and retrace its steps. Empirically, NUTS performs at least as eﬃciently as (and sometimes more eﬃciently than) a well tuned standard HMC method, without requiring user intervention or costly tuning runs. We also derive a method for adapting the step size parameter on the ﬂy based on primal-dual averaging. NUTS can thus be used with no hand-tuning at all, making it suitable for applications such as BUGS-style automatic inference engines that require eﬃcient “turnkey” samplers.},

To counteract this negative development, a multicomponent intervention study based on the main ideas of self-determination theory, students’ emotions in relation to maths, and the concept of self-regulation was developed and implemented in Swiss seventh-grade maths classes with basic demands. The study applied a quasi-experimental design comparing two experimental groups (combined student/teacher group: teachers and students participated in the intervention; student-only group: only students participated in the intervention) and a control group. Intervention effects were evaluated longitudinally (pre-post test) via self-reports of 348 students. Within-group results (t tests) showed no significant changes for students in the control group, a significant decrease in intrinsic and identified motivation for students in the student-only group, and a significant increase in intrinsic motivation and self-concept for students in the combined student/teacher group. Multivariate analyses of covariance controlling for pre-test variables as well as gender and migration background showed significant group effects. As the most positive effects were found for students in the student/teacher group, the results highlight the importance of co-constructed teaching and learning.},

This Viewpoint of infectious aerosols is intended to inform appropriate infection control measures to protect health-care workers. Studies of cough aerosols and of exhaled breath from patients with various respiratory infections have shown striking similarities in aerosol size distributions, with a predominance of pathogens in small particles ({\textless}5 μm). These are immediately respirable, suggesting the need for personal respiratory protection (respirators) for individuals in close proximity to patients with potentially virulent pathogens. There is no evidence that some pathogens are carried only in large droplets. Surgical masks might offer some respiratory protection from inhalation of infectious aerosols, but not as much as respirators. However, surgical masks worn by patients reduce exposures to infectious aerosols to health-care workers and other individuals. The variability of infectious aerosol production, with some so-called super-emitters producing much higher amounts of infectious aerosol than most, might help to explain the epidemiology of super-spreading. Airborne infection control measures are indicated for potentially lethal respiratory pathogens such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.},

Guidelines recommend using aerosol precautions during aerosol-generating procedures, and droplet ({\textgreater} 5 µm) precautions at other times. However, emerging evidence indicates respiratory activities may be a more important source of aerosols than clinical procedures such as tracheal intubation. We aimed to measure the size, total number and volume of all human aerosols exhaled during respiratory activities and therapies. We used a novel chamber with an optical particle counter sampling at 100 l.min-1 to count and size-fractionate close to all exhaled particles (0.5–25 µm). We compared emissions from ten healthy subjects during six respiratory activities (quiet breathing; talking; shouting; forced expiratory manoeuvres; exercise; and coughing) with three respiratory therapies (high-flow nasal oxygen and single or dual circuit non-invasive positive pressure ventilation). Activities were repeated while wearing facemasks. When compared with quiet breathing, exertional respiratory activities increased particle counts 34.6-fold during talking and 370.8-fold during coughing (p {\textless} 0.001). High-flow nasal oxygen 60 at l.min-1 increased particle counts 2.3-fold (p = 0.031) during quiet breathing. Single and dual circuit non-invasive respiratory therapy at 25/10 cm.H2O with quiet breathing increased counts by 2.6-fold and 7.8-fold, respectively (both p {\textless} 0.001). During exertional activities, respiratory therapies and facemasks reduced emissions compared with activities alone. Respiratory activities (including exertional breathing and coughing) which mimic respiratory patterns during illness generate substantially more aerosols than non-invasive respiratory therapies, which conversely can reduce total emissions. We argue the risk of aerosol exposure is underappreciated and warrants widespread, targeted interventions.},

	abstract = {Rationale: South African adolescents carry a high tuberculosis disease burden. It is not known if schools are high-risk settings for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) transmission.

Objectives: To detect airborne MTB genomic DNA in classrooms.

Methods: We studied 72 classrooms occupied by 2,262 students in two South African schools. High-volume air filtration was performed for median 40 (interquartile range [IQR], 35–54) minutes and assayed by droplet digital PCR (ddPCR)-targeting MTB region of difference 9 (RD9), with concurrent CO2 concentration measurement. Classroom data were benchmarked against public health clinics. Students who consented to individual tuberculosis screening completed a questionnaire and sputum collection (Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra) if symptom positive. Poisson statistics were used for MTB RD9 copy quantification.

Measurements and Main Results: ddPCR assays were positive in 13/72 (18.1\%) classrooms and 4/39 (10.3\%) clinic measurements (P = 0.276). Median ambient CO2 concentration was 886 (IQR, 747–1223) ppm in classrooms versus 490 (IQR, 405–587) ppm in clinics (P {\textless} 0.001). Average airborne concentration of MTB RD9 was 3.61 copies per 180,000 liters in classrooms versus 1.74 copies per 180,000 liters in clinics (P = 0.280). Across all classrooms, the average risk of an occupant inhaling one MTB RD9 copy was estimated as 0.71\% during one standard lesson of 35 minutes. Among 1,836/2,262 (81.2\%) students who consented to screening, 21/90 (23.3\%) symptomatic students produced a sputum sample, of which one was Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra positive.

Conclusions: Airborne MTB genomic DNA was detected frequently in high school classrooms. Instantaneous risk of classroom exposure was similar to the risk in public health clinics.},

	abstract = {Background: Airborne transmission is the spread of an infectious agent caused by the dissemination of droplet nuclei (aerosols) that remain infectious when suspended in the air. We carried out a systematic review to identify, appraise and summarise the evidence from studies of the role of airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Methods: We searched LitCovid, MedRxiv, Google Scholar and the WHO Covid-19 database from 1 February to 20 December 2020 and included studies on airborne transmission. Data were dual extracted and we assessed quality using a modified QUADAS 2 risk of bias tool. Results: We included 67 primary studies and 22 reviews on airborne SARS-CoV-2. Of the 67 primary studies, 53 (79\%) reported data on RT-PCR from air samples, 12 (18\%) report cycle threshold values and 18 (127\%) copies per sample volume. All primary studies were observational and of low quality. The research often lacked standard methods, standard sampling sizes and reporting items. We found 36 descriptions of different air samplers deployed. Of the 42 studies conducted in-hospital that reported binary RT-PCR tests, 24 (57\%) reported positive results for SARs-CoV-2 (142 positives out of 1,403 samples: average 10.1\%, range 0\% to 100\%). There was no pattern between the type of hospital setting (ICU versus non-ICU) and RT-PCR positivity. Seventeen studies reported potential air transmission in the outdoors or in the community, of which seven performed RT-PCR sampling, and two studies reported weak positive RNA samples for 2 or more genes (5 of 125 samples positive: average 4.0\%). Ten studies attempted viral culture with no serial passage. Conclusion: \&nbsp;SARS-CoV-2 RNA is detected intermittently in the air in various settings. Standardized guidelines for conducting and reporting research on airborne transmission are needed. The lack of recoverable viral culture samples of SARS-CoV-2 prevents firm conclusions from being drawn about airborne transmission.},

	abstract = {The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has highlighted the need for improved technologies to help control the spread of contagious pathogens. While rapid point-of-need testing plays a key role in strategies to rapidly identify and isolate infectious patients, current test approaches have significant shortcomings related to assay limitations and sample type. Direct quantification of viral shedding in exhaled particles may offer a better rapid testing approach, since SARS-CoV-2 is believed to spread mainly by aerosols. It assesses contagiousness directly, the sample is easy and comfortable to obtain, sampling can be standardized, and the limited sample volume lends itself to a fast and sensitive analysis. In view of these benefits, we developed and tested an approach where exhaled particles are efficiently sampled using inertial impaction in a micromachined silicon chip, followed by an RT-qPCR molecular assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 shedding. Our portable, silicon impactor allowed for the efficient capture ({\textgreater}85\%) of respiratory particles down to 300 nm without the need for additional equipment. We demonstrate using both conventional off-chip and in-situ PCR directly on the silicon chip that sampling subjects’ breath in less than a minute yields sufficient viral RNA to detect infections as early as standard sampling methods. A longitudinal study revealed clear differences in the temporal dynamics of viral load for nasopharyngeal swab, saliva, breath, and antigen tests. Overall, after an infection, the breath-based test remains positive during the first week but is the first to consistently report a negative result, putatively signalling the end of contagiousness and further emphasizing the potential of this tool to help manage the spread of airborne respiratory infections.
A widely used analytical model to quantitatively assess airborne infection risk is the Wells-Riley model which is limited to complete air mixing in a single zone. However, this assumption tends not to be feasible (or reality) for many situations. This study aimed to extend the Wells-Riley model so that the infection risk can be calculated in spaces where complete mixing is not present. Some more advanced ventilation concepts create either two horizontally divided air zones in spaces as displacement ventilation or the space may be divided into two vertical zones by downward plane jet as in protective-zone ventilation systems. This is done by evaluating the time-dependent distribution of infectious quanta in each zone and by solving the coupled system of differential equations based on the zonal quanta concentrations. This model introduces a novel approach by estimating the interzonal mixing factor based on previous experimental data for three types of ventilation systems: incomplete mixing ventilation, displacement ventilation, and protective zone ventilation. The modeling approach is applied to a room with one infected and one susceptible person present. The results show that using the Wells-Riley model based on the assumption of completely air mixing may considerably overestimate or underestimate the long-range airborne infection risk in rooms where air distribution is different than complete mixing, such as displacement ventilation, protected zone ventilation, warm air supplied from the ceiling, etc. Therefore, in spaces with non-uniform air distribution, a zonal modeling approach should be preferred in analytical models compared to the conventional single-zone Wells-Riley models when assessing long-range airborne transmission risk of infectious respiratory diseases.
Reusability of masks is a rising environmental concern. Community face masks present a more eco-friendly option as they can be washed and reused several times. The potential reuse of single use medical face masks is also of interest. In this work, the impact of 20 wash cycles (at 60 °C with detergent and air-drying) on the particle filtration efficiency (particle size range 0.1–6.​ 5μm{\textless}math{\textgreater}{\textless}mrow is="true"{\textgreater}{\textless}mn is="true"{\textgreater}5{\textless}/mn{\textgreater}{\textless}mspace width="1em" class="nbsp" is="true"{\textgreater}{\textless}/mspace{\textgreater}{\textless}mi is="true" mathvariant="normal"{\textgreater}μ{\textless}/mi{\textgreater}{\textless}mi is="true" mathvariant="normal"{\textgreater}m{\textless}/mi{\textgreater}{\textless}/mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}/math{\textgreater}) and breathability of masks was studied. With regards to the performance of new masks, the medical mask had breathability of 31 Pa.cm −2 whilst it ranged from 9 to 59 Pa.cm −2 for the community face masks. Additionally, for 3μm{\textless}math{\textgreater}{\textless}mrow is="true"{\textgreater}{\textless}mn is="true"{\textgreater}3{\textless}/mn{\textgreater}{\textless}mspace width="1em" class="nbsp" is="true"{\textgreater}{\textless}/mspace{\textgreater}{\textless}mi is="true" mathvariant="normal"{\textgreater}μ{\textless}/mi{\textgreater}{\textless}mi is="true" mathvariant="normal"{\textgreater}m{\textless}/mi{\textgreater}{\textless}/mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}/math{\textgreater} particles, the filtration efficiency was 99\% for the medical mask and ranged from 28\%–89\% for the community face masks. Mixed fabric masks were able to maintain their performance up to 20 washing cycles. The washed 100\% cotton masks were less breathable but with higher filtration efficiency because of shrinkage of the fabric. The washed medical face mask was able to maintain its breathability and filtration efficiency for sizes ≥{\textless}math{\textgreater}{\textless}mo is="true"{\textgreater}≥{\textless}/mo{\textgreater}{\textless}/math{\textgreater} 3μm{\textless}math{\textgreater}{\textless}mrow is="true"{\textgreater}{\textless}mn is="true"{\textgreater}3{\textless}/mn{\textgreater}{\textless}mspace width="1em" class="nbsp" is="true"{\textgreater}{\textless}/mspace{\textgreater}{\textless}mi is="true" mathvariant="normal"{\textgreater}μ{\textless}/mi{\textgreater}{\textless}mi is="true" mathvariant="normal"{\textgreater}m{\textless}/mi{\textgreater}{\textless}/mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}/math{\textgreater}, however the filtration efficiency was significantly reduced for the submicron particles.

Air pollution and associated particulate matter (PM) affect environmental and human health worldwide. The intense vehicle usage and the high population density in urban areas are the main causes of this public health impact. Epidemiological studies have provided evidence on the effect of air pollution on airborne SARS-CoV-2 transmission and COVID-19 disease prevalence and symptomatology. However, the causal relationship between air pollution and COVID-19 is still under investigation. Based on these results, the question addressed in this study was how long SARS-CoV-2 survives on the surface of PM from different origin to evaluate the relationship between fuel and atmospheric pollution and virus transmission risk. The persistence and viability of SARS-CoV-2 virus was characterized in 5 engine exhaust PM and 4 samples of atmospheric PM10. The results showed that SARS-CoV-2 remains on the surface of PM10 from air pollutants but interaction with engine exhaust PM inactivates the virus. Consequently, atmospheric PM10 levels may increase SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk thus supporting a causal relationship between these factors. Furthermore, the relationship of pollution PM and particularly engine exhaust PM with virus transmission risk and COVID-19 is also affected by the impact of these pollutants on host oxidative stress and immunity. Therefore, although fuel PM inactivates SARS-CoV-2, the conclusion of the study is that both atmospheric and engine exhaust PM negatively impact human health with implications for COVID-19 and other diseases.
We performed exhaled breath (EB) and nasopharyngeal (NP) quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and NP rapid antigen testing (NP RAT) of SARS-CoV-2 infections with different variants.
We included immuno-naïve alpha-infected (n = 11) and partly boosted omicron-infected patients (n = 8) as high-risk contacts. We compared peak NP and EB qPCR cycle time (ct) values between cohorts (Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test). Test positivity was compared for three infection phases using Cochran Q test.
Peak median NP ct was 11.5 (interquartile range [IQR] 10.1-12.1) for alpha and 12.2 (IQR 11.1-15.3) for omicron infections. Peak median EB ct was 25.2 (IQR 24.5-26.9) and 28.3 (IQR 26.4-30.8) for alpha and omicron infections, respectively. Distributions did not differ between cohorts for NP (P = 0.19) or EB (P = 0.09). SARS-CoV-2 shedding peaked on day 1 in EB (confidence interval [CI] 0.0 - 4.5) and day 3 in NP (CI 1.5 - 6.0). EB qPCR positivity equaled NP qPCR positivity on D0-D1 (P = 0.44) and D2-D6 (P = 1.0). It superseded NP RAT positivity on D0-D1 (P = 0.003) and D2-D6 (P = 0.008). It was inferior to both on D7-D10 (P {\textless} 0.001).
Peak EB and nasopharynx shedding were comparable across variants. EB qPCR positivity matched NP qPCR and superseded NP RAT in the first week of infection.
Industrial hygienists (IH) in the oil and gas business instituted an extraordinary number of safety protocols to limit spread of SARS-CoV-2 onto offshore platforms in the Gulf of Mexico. We used genomic surveillance to provide actionable information concerning the efficacy of their efforts.
Over 6 months, employees at a single company were serology and PCR tested during a 1-5 day predeployment quarantine and when postdeployment symptoms were reported. From each positive test (n = 49), SARS-CoV-2 genomes were sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis was used to investigate the epidemiology of transmissions.
Genomic surveillance confirmed 2 viral strains were infecting 18 offshore workers. Genomic data combined with epidemiological data suggested that a change in quarantine protocols contributed to these outbreaks. A pre-deployment outbreak involved a WHO variant of interest (Theta) that had infected 4 international workers. Two additional predeployment clusters of infections were identified.
Our findings support that IH quarantine/testing protocols limited viral transmissions, halted offshore outbreaks, and stopped the spread of a variant of interest. The study demonstrates how genomic data can be used to understand viral transmission dynamics in employee populations and evaluate safety protocols in the offshore oil and gas industry.},

	abstract = {Multiple severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) superspreading events suggest that aerosols play an important role in driving the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. To better understand how airborne SARS-CoV-2 transmission occurs, we sought to determine viral loads within coarse (\&gt;5 μm) and fine (≤5 μm) respiratory aerosols produced when breathing, talking, and singing.Using a G-II exhaled breath collector, we measured viral RNA in coarse and fine respiratory aerosols emitted by COVID-19 patients during 30 minutes of breathing, 15 minutes of talking, and 15 minutes of singing.Thirteen participants (59\%) emitted detectable levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in respiratory aerosols, including 3 asymptomatic and 1 presymptomatic patient. Viral loads ranged from 63–5821 N gene copies per expiratory activity per participant, with high person-to-person variation. Patients earlier in illness were more likely to emit detectable RNA. Two participants, sampled on day 3 of illness, accounted for 52\% of total viral load. Overall, 94\% of SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies were emitted by talking and singing. Interestingly, 7 participants emitted more virus from talking than singing. Overall, fine aerosols constituted 85\% of the viral load detected in our study. Virus cultures were negative.Fine aerosols produced by talking and singing contain more SARS-CoV-2 copies than coarse aerosols and may play a significant role in SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Exposure to fine aerosols, especially indoors, should be mitigated. Isolating viable SARS-CoV-2 from respiratory aerosol samples remains challenging; whether this can be more easily accomplished for emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants is an urgent enquiry necessitating larger-scale studies.},

Design  Rapid systematic review and meta-­analysis of observational research. Setting  International studies on incubation period of COVID-19. Participants  Searches were carried out in PubMed, Google Scholar, Embase, Cochrane Library as well as the preprint servers MedRxiv and BioRxiv. Studies were selected for meta-­analysis if they reported either the parameters and CIs of the distributions fit to the data, or sufficient information to facilitate calculation of those values. After initial eligibility screening, 24 studies were selected for initial review, nine of these were shortlisted for meta-­analysis. Final estimates are from meta-­analysis of eight studies. Primary outcome measures  Parameters of a lognormal distribution of incubation periods.
Results  The incubation period distribution may be modelled with a lognormal distribution with pooled mu and sigma parameters (95\% CIs) of 1.63 (95\% CI 1.51 to 1.75) and 0.50 (95\% CI 0.46 to 0.55), respectively. The corresponding mean (95\% CIs) was 5.8 (95\% CI 5.0 to 6.7) days. It should be noted that uncertainty increases towards the tail of the distribution: the pooled parameter estimates (95\% CIs) resulted in a median incubation period of 5.1 (95\% CI 4.5 to 5.8) days, whereas the 95th percentile was 11.7 (95\% CI 9.7 to 14.2) days.
Conclusions  The choice of which parameter values are adopted will depend on how the information is used, the associated risks and the perceived consequences of decisions to be taken. These recommendations will need to be revisited once further relevant information becomes available. Accordingly, we present an R Shiny app that facilitates updating these estimates as new data become available.},

	abstract = {Objectives
Because the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in aerosols but failure to isolate viable (infectious) virus are commonly reported, there is substantial controversy whether severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can be transmitted through aerosols. This conundrum occurs because common air samplers can inactivate virions through their harsh collection processes. We sought to resolve the question whether viable SARS-CoV-2 can occur in aerosols using VIVAS air samplers that operate on a gentle water vapor condensation principle.
Methods
Air samples collected in the hospital room of two coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) patients, one ready for discharge and the other newly admitted, were subjected to RT-qPCR and virus culture. The genomes of the SARS-CoV-2 collected from the air and isolated in cell culture were sequenced.
Results
Viable SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from air samples collected 2 to 4.8 m away from the patients. The genome sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 strain isolated from the material collected by the air samplers was identical to that isolated from the newly admitted patient. Estimates of viable viral concentrations ranged from 6 to 74 TCID50 units/L of air.
Conclusions
Patients with respiratory manifestations of COVID-19 produce aerosols in the absence of aerosol-generating procedures that contain viable SARS-CoV-2, and these aerosols may serve as a source of transmission of the virus.},

	abstract = {Background
Understanding how severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is spread within the hospital setting is essential in order to protect staff, implement effective infection control measures, and prevent nosocomial transmission.
Methods
The presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the air and on environmental surfaces around hospitalized patients, with and without respiratory symptoms, was investigated. Environmental sampling was undertaken within eight hospitals in England during the first wave of the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak. Samples were analysed using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and virus isolation assays.
Findings
SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected on 30 (8.9\%) of 336 environmental surfaces. Cycle threshold values ranged from 28.8 to 39.1, equating to 2.2 x 105 to 59 genomic copies/swab. Concomitant bacterial counts were low, suggesting that the cleaning performed by nursing and domestic staff across all eight hospitals was effective. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in four of 55 air samples taken {\textless}1 m from four different patients. In all cases, the concentration of viral RNA was low and ranged from {\textless}10 to 460 genomic copies/m3 air. Infectious virus was not recovered from any of the PCR-positive samples analysed.
Conclusions
Effective cleaning can reduce the risk of fomite (contact) transmission, but some surface types may facilitate the survival, persistence and/or dispersal of SARS-CoV-2. The presence of low or undetectable concentrations of viral RNA in the air supports current guidance on the use of specific personal protective equipment for aerosol-generating and non-aerosol-generating procedures.},

Methods and Results Fine aerosols ({\textless}500 nm) containing MS2 coliphage were generated from a Collison nebulizer, conditioned by a dilution dryer and collected by a GTC and a BioSampler. The GTC effectively condensed water vapour onto the virus particles, creating droplets 2–5 μm in diameter, which facilitated collection. Comparison of particle counts upstream and downstream revealed that the GTC collected {\textgreater}93\% of the inlet virus particles, whereas the BioSampler's efficiency was about 10\%. Viable counts of the GTC-collected viruses were also one order of magnitude higher than those of the BioSampler (P = 0·003). Conclusion The efficiency of the GTC for the viable collection of MS2 viruses exceeds that of industry standard instrument, the BioSampler, by a factor of 10–100. Significance and Impact of the Study This study reveals that the GTC is an effective collector of viable MS2 aerosols, and concludes the instrument will be an effective tool for studying viable virus aerosols and the inhalation risks posed by airborne viruses.},

	abstract = {Background: The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic is a public health emergency of international concern and poses a challenge to psychological resilience. Research data are needed to develop evidence-driven strategies to reduce adverse psychological impacts and psychiatric symptoms during the epidemic. The aim of this study was to survey the general public in China to better understand their levels of psychological impact, anxiety, depression, and stress during the initial stage of the COVID-19 outbreak. The data will be used for future reference. Methods: From 31 January to 2 February 2020, we conducted an online survey using snowball sampling techniques. The online survey collected information on demographic data, physical symptoms in the past 14 days, contact history with COVID-19, knowledge and concerns about COVID-19, precautionary measures against COVID-19, and additional information required with respect to COVID-19. Psychological impact was assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and mental health status was assessed by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). Results: This study included 1210 respondents from 194 cities in China. In total, 53.8\% of respondents rated the psychological impact of the outbreak as moderate or severe; 16.5\% reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms; 28.8\% reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms; and 8.1\% reported moderate to severe stress levels. Most respondents spent 20-24 h per day at home (84.7\%); were worried about their family members contracting COVID-19 (75.2\%); and were satisfied with the amount of health information available (75.1\%). Female gender, student status, specific physical symptoms (e.g., myalgia, dizziness, coryza), and poor self-rated health status were significantly associated with a greater psychological impact of the outbreak and higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (p {\textless} 0.05). Specific up-to-date and accurate health information (e.g., treatment, local outbreak situation) and particular precautionary measures (e.g., hand hygiene, wearing a mask) were associated with a lower psychological impact of the outbreak and lower levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (p {\textless} 0.05). Conclusions: During the initial phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, more than half of the respondents rated the psychological impact as moderate-to-severe, and about one-third reported moderate-to-severe anxiety. Our findings identify factors associated with a lower level of psychological impact and better mental health status that can be used to formulate psychological interventions to improve the mental health of vulnerable groups during the COVID-19 epidemic.},

Design Baseline measurements of a longitudinal cohort study (Ciao Corona) from June to July 2020.
Setting 55 schools stratified by district in the canton of Zurich, Switzerland.
Participants 2585 children (1339 girls; median age: 11 years, age range: 6–16 years), attending grades 1–2, 4–5 and 7–8.
Main outcome measures Variation in seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in children across 12 cantonal districts, schools and grades, assessed using Luminex-based test of four epitopes for IgG, IgA and IgM (Antibody Coronavirus Assay,ABCORA 2.0). Clustering of cases within classes. Association of seropositivity and symptoms. Comparison with seroprevalence in adult population, assessed using Luminex-based test of IgG and IgA (Sensitive Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Spike Trimer Immunoglobulin Serological test).
Results Overall seroprevalence was 2.8\% (95\% CI 1.5\% to 4.1\%), ranging from 1.0\% to 4.5\% across districts. Seroprevalence in grades 1–2 was 3.8\% (95\% CI 2.0\% to 6.1\%), in grades 4–5 was 2.4\% (95\% CI 1.1\% to 4.2\%) and in grades 7–8 was 1.5\% (95\% CI 0.5\% to 3.0\%). At least one seropositive child was present in 36 of 55 (65\%) schools and in 44 (34\%) of 131 classes where ≥5 children and ≥50\% of children within the class were tested. 73\% of children reported COVID-19-compatible symptoms since January 2020, with the same frequency in seropositive and seronegative children for all symptoms. Seroprevalence of children and adults was similar (3.2\%, 95\% credible interval (CrI) 1.7\% to 5.0\% vs 3.6\%, 95\% CrI 1.7\% to 5.4\%). The ratio of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cumulative incidence-to-seropositive cases was 1:89 in children and 1:12 in adults.
Conclusions SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was low in children and similar to that in adults by the end of June 2020. Very low ratio of diagnosed-to-seropositive children was observed. We did not detect clustering of SARS-CoV-2-seropositive children within classes, but the follow-up of this study will shed more light on transmission within schools.

	abstract = {Objectives To evaluate the risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in naturally ventilated hospital settings by measuring parameters of ventilation and comparing these findings with results of bioaerosol sampling.
Study design Cross-sectional study.
Study setting and study sample The study sample included nine hospitals in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Ventilation characteristics and air samples were collected from 86 healthcare spaces during October 2020 to February 2021.
Primary outcome Risk of cumulative SARS-CoV-2 infection by type of healthcare area.
Secondary outcomes Ventilation rates by healthcare space; risk of airborne detection of SARS-CoV-2 across healthcare spaces; impact of room characteristics on absolute ventilation; SARS-CoV-2 detection by naturally ventilated versus mechanically ventilated spaces.
Results The majority (78.7\%) of naturally ventilated patient care rooms had ventilation rates that fell short of the recommended ventilation rate of 60 L/s/p. Using a modified Wells-Riley equation and local COVID-19 case numbers, we found that over a 40-hour exposure period, outpatient departments posed the highest median risk for infection (7.7\%). SARS-CoV-2 RNA was most frequently detected in air samples from non-COVID wards (50.0\%) followed by outpatient departments (42.9\%). Naturally ventilated spaces (22.6\%) had higher rates of SARS-CoV-2 detection compared with mechanically ventilated spaces (8.3\%), though the difference was not statistically significant (p=0.128). In multivariable linear regression with calculated elasticity, open door area and cross-ventilation were found to have a significant impact on ventilation.
Conclusion Our findings provide evidence that naturally ventilated healthcare settings may pose a high risk for exposure to SARS-CoV-2, particularly among non-COVID-designated spaces, but improving parameters of ventilation can mitigate this risk.},

Uncertain about the health risk and an increasing financial loss will contribute to widespread emotional distress and an increased risk of psychiatric disorders shortly. Posttraumatic, anxiety, and depression disorders are expected during and aftermath of the pandemic. Some groups, like children, have more susceptibility to having long term consequences in mental health. Herein, we made a comprehensive and non-systematic search in four databases (PubMed, Scopus, SciELO, and Google Scholars) to answer the question: What are children's and adolescents' mental health effects of the pandemic? Furthermore, which features are essential for mental health in a pandemic? Results: Seventy-seven articles were selected for full text read, and 51 were included. Children answer stress differently, depending on the development stage. High rates of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic symptoms were identified among children. Discussion: Symptoms were as expected. New supportive strategies have appeared during this pandemic, but there is no measure of its effectiveness. Some groups seem to be more vulnerable to the mental health burden of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the mitigation actions should prioritize them. The school's role appears to be revalued by society. This review seems to pick good targets to prioritize mitigation actions aiming to spare children not only from the severe cases of COVID-19 but also to help them to deal with the mental health burden of the pandemics.},

	abstract = {Objective
Disease containment of COVID-19 has necessitated widespread social isolation. We aimed to establish what is known about how loneliness and disease containment measures impact on the mental health in children and adolescents.
Method
For this rapid review, we searched MEDLINE, PsycInfo, and Web of Science for articles published between January 1, 1946, and March 29, 2020. Of the articles, 20\% were double screened using predefined criteria, and 20\% of data was double extracted for quality assurance.
Results
A total of 83 articles (80 studies) met inclusion criteria. Of these, 63 studies reported on the impact of social isolation and loneliness on the mental health of previously healthy children and adolescents (n = 51,576; mean age 15.3 years). In all, 61 studies were observational, 18 were longitudinal, and 43 were cross-sectional studies assessing self-reported loneliness in healthy children and adolescents. One of these studies was a retrospective investigation after a pandemic. Two studies evaluated interventions. Studies had a high risk of bias, although longitudinal studies were of better methodological quality. Social isolation and loneliness increased the risk of depression, and possibly anxiety at the time at which loneliness was measured and between 0.25 and 9 years later. Duration of loneliness was more strongly correlated with mental health symptoms than intensity of loneliness.
Conclusion
Children and adolescents are probably more likely to experience high rates of depression and most likely anxiety during and after enforced isolation ends. This may increase as enforced isolation continues. Clinical services should offer preventive support and early intervention where possible and be prepared for an increase in mental health problems.},

	abstract = {Human respiratory virus infections lead to a spectrum of respiratory symptoms and disease severity, contributing to substantial morbidity, mortality and economic losses worldwide, as seen in the COVID-19 pandemic. Belonging to diverse families, respiratory viruses differ in how easy they spread (transmissibility) and the mechanism (modes) of transmission. Transmissibility as estimated by the basic reproduction number (R0) or secondary attack rate is heterogeneous for the same virus. Respiratory viruses can be transmitted via four major modes of transmission: direct (physical) contact, indirect contact (fomite), (large) droplets and (fine) aerosols. We know little about the relative contribution of each mode to the transmission of a particular virus in different settings, and how its variation affects transmissibility and transmission dynamics. Discussion on the particle size threshold between droplets and aerosols and the importance of aerosol transmission for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and influenza virus is ongoing. Mechanistic evidence supports the efficacies of non-pharmaceutical interventions with regard to virus reduction; however, more data are needed on their effectiveness in reducing transmission. Understanding the relative contribution of different modes to transmission is crucial to inform the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions in the population. Intervening against multiple modes of transmission should be more effective than acting on a single mode.},

	abstract = {Familiarity with the use of face coverings to reduce the risk of respiratory disease has increased during the coronavirus pandemic; however, recommendations for their use outside of the pandemic remains limited. Here, we develop a modeling framework to quantify the potential health benefits of wearing a face covering or respirator to mitigate exposure to particulate air pollution. This framework accounts for the wide range of available face coverings and respirators, fit factors and efficacy, air pollution characteristics, and exposure-response data. Our modeling shows that N95 respirators offer robust protection against different sources of particulate matter, reducing exposure by more than a factor of 14 when worn with a leak rate of 5\%. Synthetic-fiber masks offer less protection with a strong dependence on aerosol size distribution (protection factors ranging from 4.4 to 2.2), while natural-fiber and surgical masks offer reductions in the exposure of 1.9 and 1.7, respectively. To assess the ability of face coverings to provide population-level health benefits to wildfire smoke, we perform a case study for the 2012 Washington state fire season. Our models suggest that although natural-fiber masks offer minor reductions in respiratory hospitalizations attributable to smoke (2\%–11\%) due to limited filtration efficiency, N95 respirators and to a lesser extent surgical and synthetic-fiber masks may lead to notable reductions in smoke-attributable hospitalizations (22\%–39\%, 9\%–24\%, and 7\%–18\%, respectively). The filtration efficiency, bypass rate, and compliance rate (fraction of time and population wearing the device) are the key factors governing exposure reduction potential and health benefits during severe wildfire smoke events.},

	abstract = {Background
Since the COVID-19 outbreak at the end of 2019, it has evolved into a global pandemic with tremendous mental health impact besides the threats to people’s physical health.
Objective
The aims were to examine whether exposure to COVID-19 predicts elevated levels of anxiety and post-traumatic stress symptoms and whether pre-pandemic maltreatment experiences exacerbate this impact on mental health in adolescents.
Participants and setting
The survey was conducted online from February 8 st to February 27th, 2020, and the questionnaires were distributed and retrieved through a web-based platform. This study includes a total of 6196 subjects, aged range from 11 to 18 years old.
Methods
Several multivariable linear regressions were used to analyse the data.
Results
The largest variance in PTSS and anxiety problems was explained by ACEs, with more pre-pandemic maltreatment experiences predicting more PTSS (effect size beta = 0.16∼0.27), and more anxiety (effect size beta = 0.32∼0.47). Experienced or subjective fear of exposure to COVID-19 predicted statistically significant variance in PTSS and anxiety, and standardized betas ranged from 0.04 to 0.09. Participants who had adverse childhood experiences and had experienced exposure to COVID-19 showed elevated PTSS.
Conclusions
After pre-pandemic maltreatment experiences the impact of exposure to COVID-19 on mental health may be stronger. Scars from the past seem to be vulnerabilities during societal upheaval. We therefore suggest that when exposed to COVID-19 rural adolescents should get prioritized professional family support and mental health counseling in particular when they have experienced family abuse and neglect in childhood, even though such support is more difficult to organize in rural areas.},

Community studies have indicated that school-age children have the highest incidence of influenza and are an important source of amplifying and sustaining community transmission that affects all age groups.A consultation to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of a universal recommendation for annual influenza vaccination of all children age ≥6 months was held in Atlanta, Georgia, in September 2007. Consultants provided summaries of current data on vaccine effectiveness, safety, supply, successful program implementation, and economics studies and discussed challenges associated with continuing a risk- and contact-based vaccination strategy compared with a universal vaccination recommendation.Consultants noted that school-age children had a substantial illness burden caused by influenza, that vaccine was safe and effective for children aged 6 months through 18 years, and that evidence suggested that vaccinating school-age children would provide benefits to both the vaccinated children and their unvaccinated household and community contacts. However, implementation of an annual recommendation for all school-age children would pose major challenges to parents, medical providers and health care systems. Alternative vaccination venues were needed, and of these school-located vaccination programs might offer the most promise as an alternative vaccination site for school-age children.Expansion of recommendations to include all school-age children will require additional development of an infrastructure to support implementation and methods to adequately evaluate impact.},

	abstract = {Objective To estimate the societal economic and health impacts of Maine's school-based influenza vaccination (SIV) program during the 2009 A(H1N1) influenza pandemic. Data Sources Primary and secondary data covering the 2008–09 and 2009–10 influenza seasons. Study Design We estimated weekly monovalent influenza vaccine uptake in Maine and 15 other states, using difference-in-difference-in-differences analysis to assess the program's impact on immunization among six age groups. We also developed a health and economic Markov microsimulation model and conducted Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis. Data Collection We used national survey data to estimate the impact of the SIV program on vaccine coverage. We used primary data and published studies to develop the microsimulation model. Principal Findings The program was associated with higher immunization among children and lower immunization among adults aged 18–49 years and 65 and older. The program prevented 4,600 influenza infections and generated \$4.9 million in net economic benefits. Cost savings from lower adult vaccination accounted for 54 percent of the economic gain. Economic benefits were positive in 98 percent of Monte Carlo simulations. Conclusions SIV may be a cost-beneficial approach to increase immunization during pandemics, but programs should be designed to prevent lower immunization among nontargeted groups.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.cmi.2018.06.009},
	abstract = {Objectives
Automated point-of-care molecular assays have greatly shortened the turnaround time of respiratory virus testing. One of the major bottlenecks now lies at the specimen collection step, especially in a busy clinical setting. Saliva is a convenient specimen type that can be provided easily by adult patients. This study assessed the diagnostic validity, specimen collection time and cost associated with the use of saliva.
Methods
This was a prospective diagnostic validity study comparing the detection rate of respiratory viruses between saliva and nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) among adult hospitalized patients using Xpert® Xpress Flu/RSV. The cost and time associated with the collection of saliva and nasopharyngeal specimens were also estimated.
Results
Between July and October 2017, 214 patients were recruited. The overall agreement between saliva and NPA was 93.3\% (196/210, κ 0.851, 95\% CI 0.776–0.926). There was no significant difference in the detection rate of respiratory viruses between saliva and NPA (32.9\% (69/210) versus 35.7\% (75/210); p 0.146). The overall sensitivity and specificity were 90.8\% (81.9\%–96.2\%) and 100\% (97.3\%–100\%), respectively, for saliva, and were 96.1\% (88.9\%–99.2\%) and 98.5\% (94.7\%–99.8\%), respectively, for NPA. The time and cost associated with the collection of saliva were 2.26-fold and 2.59-fold lower, respectively, than those of NPA.
Conclusions
Saliva specimens have high sensitivity and specificity in the detection of respiratory viruses by an automated multiplex Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments-waived point-of-care molecular assay when compared with those of NPA. The use of saliva also reduces the time and cost associated with specimen collection.},

	abstract = {The progression of COVID-19 worldwide can be tracked by identifying mutations within the genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 that occur as a function of time. Such efforts currently rely on sequencing the genome of SARS-CoV-2 in patient specimens (direct sequencing) or of virus isolated from patient specimens in cell cultures. A pilot SARS-CoV-2 air sampling study conducted at a clinic within a university student health care center detected the virus vRNA, with an estimated concentration of 0.87 virus genomes L−1 air. To determine whether the virus detected was viable (‘live’), attempts were made to isolate the virus in cell cultures. Virus-induced cytopathic effects (CPE) were observed within two days post-inoculation of Vero E6 cells with collection media from air samples; however, rtRT-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 vRNA from cell culture were negative. Instead, three other fast-growing human respiratory viruses were isolated and subsequently identified, illustrating the challenge in isolating SARS-CoV-2 when multiple viruses are present in a test sample. The complete SAR-CoV-2 genomic sequence was nevertheless determined by Sanger sequencing and most closely resembles SARS-CoV-2 genomes previously described in Georgia, USA. Results of this study illustrate the feasibility of tracking progression of the COVID-19 pandemic using environmental aerosol samples instead of human specimens. Collection of a positive sample from a distance more than 2 m away from the nearest patient traffic implies the virus was in an aerosol.},

Saliva may serve as an alternative to nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) as its collection is simple, non-invasive and amenable for mass- and home testing, but its rigorous validation, particularly in children, is missing. We conducted a large-scale head-to-head comparison of SARS-CoV-2 detection by RT-PCR in saliva and NPS of 1270 adults and children reporting to outpatient test centers and an emergency unit. In total, 273 individuals were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in either NPS or saliva. SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR results in the two specimens showed a high agreement (overall percent agreement = 97.8\%). Despite lower viral loads in the saliva of both adults and children, detection of SARS-CoV-2 in saliva fared well compared to NPS (positive percent agreement = 92.5\%). Importantly, in children, SARS-CoV-2 infections were more often detected in saliva than NPS (positive predictive value = 84.8\%), underlining that NPS sampling in children can be challenging. The comprehensive parallel analysis reported here establishes saliva as a generally reliable specimen for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, with particular advantages for testing children, that is readily applicable to increase and facilitate repetitive and mass testing in adults and children.},

A Stan program imperatively defines a log probability function over parameters conditioned on specified data and constants. As of version 2.14.0, Stan provides full Bayesian inference for continuous-variable models through Markov chain Monte Carlo methods such as the No-U-Turn sampler, an adaptive form of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling. Penalized maximum likelihood estimates are calculated using optimization methods such as the limited memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm. Stan is also a platform for computing log densities and their gradients and Hessians, which can be used in alternative algorithms such as variational Bayes, expectation propagation, and marginal inference using approximate integration. To this end, Stan is set up so that the densities, gradients, and Hessians, along with intermediate quantities of the algorithm such as acceptance probabilities, are easily accessible. Stan can be called from the command line using the cmdstan package, through R using the rstan package, and through Python using the pystan package. All three interfaces support sampling and optimization-based inference with diagnostics and posterior analysis. rstan and pystan also provide access to log probabilities, gradients, Hessians, parameter transforms, and specialized plotting.},

	abstract = {Following the detection of the new coronavirus1 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its spread outside of China, Europe has experienced large epidemics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In response, many European countries have implemented non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as the closure of schools and national lockdowns. Here we study the effect of major interventions across 11 European countries for the period from the start of the COVID-19 epidemics in February 2020 until 4 May 2020, when lockdowns started to be lifted. Our model calculates backwards from observed deaths to estimate transmission that occurred several weeks previously, allowing for the time lag between infection and death. We use partial pooling of information between countries, with both individual and shared effects on the time-varying reproduction number (Rt). Pooling allows for more information to be used, helps to overcome idiosyncrasies in the data and enables more-timely estimates. Our model relies on fixed estimates of some epidemiological parameters (such as the infection fatality rate), does not include importation or subnational variation and assumes that changes in Rt are an immediate response to interventions rather than gradual changes in behaviour. Amidst the ongoing pandemic, we rely on death data that are incomplete, show systematic biases in reporting and are subject to future consolidation. We estimate that—for all of the countries we consider here—current interventions have been sufficient to drive Rt below 1 (probability Rt {\textless} 1.0 is greater than 99\%) and achieve control of the epidemic. We estimate that across all 11 countries combined, between 12 and 15 million individuals were infected with SARS-CoV-2 up to 4 May 2020, representing between 3.2\% and 4.0\% of the population. Our results show that major non-pharmaceutical interventions—and lockdowns in particular—have had a large effect on reducing transmission. Continued intervention should be considered to keep transmission of SARS-CoV-2 under control.},

	abstract = {There is limited information on the effect of age on the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection in different settings.We reviewed published studies/data on detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection in contacts of COVID-19 cases, serological studies, and studies of infections in schools.Compared to younger/middle-aged adults, susceptibility to infection for children younger than 10 years is estimated to be significantly lower, while estimated susceptibility to infection in adults older than 60 years is higher. Serological studies suggest that younger adults (particularly those younger than 35 years) often have high cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the community. There is some evidence that given limited control measures, SARS-CoV-2 may spread robustly in secondary/high schools, and to a lesser degree in primary schools, with class size possibly affecting that spread. There is also evidence of more limited spread in schools when some mitigation measures are implemented. Several potential biases that may affect these studies are discussed.Mitigation measures should be implemented when opening schools, particularly secondary/high schools. Efforts should be undertaken to diminish mixing in younger adults, particularly individuals aged 18–35 years, to mitigate the spread of the epidemic in the community.},

We estimate the effectiveness of 17 NPIs in Europe’s second wave from subnational case and death data by introducing a flexible hierarchical Bayesian transmission model and collecting the largest dataset of NPI implementation dates across Europe. Business closures, educational institution closures, and gathering bans reduced transmission, but reduced it less than they did in the first wave. This difference is likely due to organisational safety measures and individual protective behaviours—such as distancing—which made various areas of public life safer and thereby reduced the effect of closing them. Specifically, we find smaller effects for closing educational institutions, suggesting that stringent safety measures made schools safer compared to the first wave. Second-wave estimates outperform previous estimates at predicting transmission in Europe’s third wave.},

	abstract = {Background The risk of SARS-CoV-2 (SCoV2) infection in schools and student households is typically assessed using classical epidemiology whereby transmission is based on time of symptom onset and contact tracing data. Using such methodologies may be imprecise regarding transmission events of different, simultaneous SCoV2 variants spreading with different rates and directions in a given population. We analysed with high resolution the transmission among different communities, social networks, and educational institutions and the extent of outbreaks using whole genome sequencing (WGS).
Methods and Findings We combined WGS and contact tracing spanning two pandemic waves from October 2020 to May 2021 in the Canton of Basel-City, Switzerland and performed an in-depth analysis of 235 cases relating to 22 educational institutions. We describe the caseload in educational institutions and the public health measures taken and delineate the WGS-supported outbreak surveillance.During the study period, 1,573 of 24,557 (6.4\%) children and 410 of 3,726 (11\%) staff members from educational institutions were reported SCoV2 positive. Thereof, WGS data from 83 children, 35 adult staff in 22 educational institutions and their 117 contacts (social network, families) was available and analysed. 353 contextual sequences from residents of the Canton of Basel-City sequenced through surveillance were identified to be related to cases in the educational institutions. In total, we identified 55 clusters and found that coinciding SCoV2-cases in individual educational institutions were mostly introduced from different sources such as social networks or the larger community. More transmission chains started in the community and were brought into the educational institutions than vice versa (31 vs. 13). Adolescents (12-19 years old) had the highest case prevalence over both waves compared to younger children or adults, especially for the emerging Alpha variant.
Conclusions Introduction of SCoV2 into schools accounts for most events and reflects transmission closely related to social activity, whereby teenagers and young adults contribute to significant parallel activity. Combining WGS with contact tracing is pivotal to properly inform authorities about SCoV2 infection clusters and transmission directions in educational settings and the effectiveness of enacted public health measures. The gathered data showing more clusters to seed in the community than vice versa as well as few subsequent in-school transmissions indicate that the agilely employed health measures for educational institutions helped to prevent outbreaks among staff and children.The clinical trial accession number is NCT04351503 (clinicaltrials.gov).},

	abstract = {Objectives To examine longitudinal changes in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) seroprevalence and to determine the clustering of children who were seropositive within school classes in the canton of Zurich, Switzerland from June to November 2020.
Design Prospective cohort study.
Setting Switzerland had one of the highest second waves of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Europe in autumn 2020. Keeping schools open provided a moderate to high exposure environment to study SARS-CoV-2 infections. Children from randomly selected schools and classes, stratified by district, were invited for serological testing of SARS-CoV-2. Parents completed questionnaires on sociodemographic and health related questions.
Participants 275 classes in 55 schools; 2603 children participated in June-July 2020 and 2552 in October-November 2020 (age range 6-16 years).
Main outcome measures Serology of SARS-CoV-2 in June-July and October-November 2020, clustering of children who were seropositive within classes, and symptoms in children.
Results In June-July, 74 of 2496 children with serological results were seropositive; in October-November, the number had increased to 173 of 2503. Overall SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was 2.4\% (95\% credible interval 1.4\% to 3.6\%) in the summer and 4.5\% (3.2\% to 6.0\%) in late autumn in children who were not previously seropositive, leading to an estimated 7.8\% (6.2\% to 9.5\%) of children who were ever seropositive. Seroprevalence varied across districts (in the autumn, 1.7-15.0\%). No significant differences were found among lower, middle, and upper school levels (children aged 6-9 years, 9-13 years, and 12-16 years, respectively). Among the 2223 children who had serology tests at both testing rounds, 28/70 (40\%) who were previously seropositive became seronegative, and 109/2153 (5\%) who were previously seronegative became seropositive. Symptoms were reported for 22\% of children who were seronegative and 29\% of children who were newly seropositive since the summer. Between July and November 2020, the ratio of children diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection to those who were seropositive was 1 to 8. At least one child who was newly seropositive was detected in 47 of 55 schools and in 90 of 275 classes. Among 130 classes with a high participation rate, no children who were seropositive were found in 73 (56\%) classes, one or two children were seropositive in 50 (38\%) classes, and at least three children were seropositive in 7 (5\%) classes. Class level explained 24\% and school level 8\% of variance in seropositivity in the multilevel logistic regression models.
Conclusions With schools open since August 2020 and some preventive measures in place, clustering of children who were seropositive occurred in only a few classes despite an increase in overall seroprevalence during a period of moderate to high transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the community. Uncertainty remains as to whether these findings will change with the new variants of SARS-CoV-2 and dynamic levels of community transmission.

We investigated relationships between VRs and IA in California elementary schools over two school years in 162 3rd–5th-grade classrooms in 28 schools in three school districts: South Coast (SC), Bay Area (BA), and Central Valley (CV). We estimated relationships between daily IA and VR (estimated from two year daily real-time carbon dioxide in each classroom) in zero-inflated negative binomial models. We also compared IA benefits and energy costs of increased VRs. All school districts had median VRs below the 7.1 l/s-person California standard. For each additional 1 l/s-person of VR, IA was reduced significantly (p{\textless}0.05) in models for combined districts (−1.6\%) and for SC (−1.2\%), and nonsignificantly for districts providing less data: BA (−1.5\%) and CV (−1.0\%). Assuming associations were causal and generalizable, increasing classroom VRs from the California average (4 l/s-person) to the State standard would decrease IA by 3.4\%, increase attendance-linked funding to schools by \$33 million annually, and increase costs by only \$4 million. Further increasing VRs would provide additional benefits. These findings, while requiring confirmation, suggest that increasing classroom VRs above the State standard would substantially decrease illness absence and produce economic benefits.},

	abstract = {The role of ventilation in preventing tuberculosis (TB) transmission has been widely proposed in infection control guidance. However, conclusive evidence is lacking. Modeling suggested the threshold of ventilation rate to reduce effective reproductive ratio (ratio between new secondary infectious cases and source cases) of TB to below 1 is corresponding to a carbon dioxide (CO2) level of 1000 parts per million (ppm). Here, we measured the effect of improving ventilation rate on a TB outbreak involving 27 TB cases and 1665 contacts in underventilated university buildings. Ventilation engineering decreased the maximum CO2 levels from 3204 ± 50 ppm to 591-603 ppm. Thereafter, the secondary attack rate of new contacts in university dropped to zero (mean follow-up duration: 5.9 years). Exposure to source TB cases under CO2 {\textgreater}1000 ppm indoor environment was a significant risk factor for contacts to become new infectious TB cases (P {\textless} .001). After adjusting for effects of contact investigation and latent TB infection treatment, improving ventilation rate to levels with CO2 {\textless}1000 ppm was independently associated with a 97\% decrease (95\% CI: 50\%-99.9\%) in the incidence of TB among contacts. These results show that maintaining adequate indoor ventilation could be a highly effective strategy for controlling TB outbreaks.},

	doi = {10.1016/S0140-6736(03)14897-0},
	abstract = {Background
Workers in modern office buildings frequently have unexplained work-related symptoms or combinations of symptoms. We assessed whether ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) of drip pans and cooling coils within ventilation systems of office buildings would reduce microbial contamination, and thus occupants' work-related symptoms.
Methods
We undertook a double blind, multiple crossover trial of 771 participants. In office buildings in Montreal, Canada, UVGI was alternately off for 12 weeks, then turned on for 4 weeks. We did this three times with UVGI on and three times with it off, for 48 consecutive weeks. Primary outcomes of self-reported work-related symptoms, and secondary outcomes of endotoxin and viable microbial concentrations in air and on surfaces, and other environmental covariates were measured six times.
Findings
Operation of UVGI resulted in 99\% (95\% CI 67–100) reduction of microbial and endotoxin concentrations on irradiated surfaces within the ventilation systems. 771 participants appeared to remain masked, and reported no adverse effects. On the basis of within-person estimates, use of UVGI was associated with significantly fewer work-related symptoms overall (adjusted odds ratio 0·8 [95\% Cl 0·7–0·99]), as well as respiratory (0·6 [0·4–0·9]) and mucosal (0·7 [0·6–0·9]) symptoms than was non-use. Reduction of work-related mucosal symptoms was greatest among atopic workers (0·6 [0·5–0·8]), and never-smokers (0·7 [0·5–0·9]). With UVGI on, never-smokers also had large reduction of work-related respiratory (0·4 [0·2–0·9]), and musculoskeletal symptoms (0·5 [0·3–0·9]).
Interpretation
Installation of UGVI in most North American offices could resolve work-related symptoms in about 4 million employees, caused by microbial contamination of heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning systems. The cost of UVGI installation could in the long run prove cost-effective compared with the yearly losses from absence because of building-related illness.},

	abstract = {During the rapid rise in COVID-19 illnesses and deaths globally, and notwithstanding recommended precautions, questions are voiced about routes of transmission for this pandemic disease. Inhaling small airborne droplets is probable as a third route of infection, in addition to more widely recognized transmission via larger respiratory droplets and direct contact with infected people or contaminated surfaces. While uncertainties remain regarding the relative contributions of the different transmission pathways, we argue that existing evidence is sufficiently strong to warrant engineering controls targeting airborne transmission as part of an overall strategy to limit infection risk indoors. Appropriate building engineering controls include sufficient and effective ventilation, possibly enhanced by particle filtration and air disinfection, avoiding air recirculation and avoiding overcrowding. Often, such measures can be easily implemented and without much cost, but if only they are recognised as significant in contributing to infection control goals. We believe that the use of engineering controls in public buildings, including hospitals, shops, offices, schools, kindergartens, libraries, restaurants, cruise ships, elevators, conference rooms or public transport, in parallel with effective application of other controls (including isolation and quarantine, social distancing and hand hygiene), would be an additional important measure globally to reduce the likelihood of transmission and thereby protect healthcare workers, patients and the general public.},

Opportunistic airborne transmission of potentially pathogenic bioaerosols may be one possible reason for this persistence. Therefore, this study aimed to systematically review the concentrations and compositions of indoor bioaerosols in different areas within hospitals and the effects of different ventilation systems. Electronic databases (Medline and Web of Science) were searched to identify articles of interest. The search was restricted to articles published from 2000 to 2017 in English. Aggregate data was used to examine the differences in mean colony forming units per cubic metre (cfu/m3) between different hospital areas and ventilation types. A total of 36 journal articles met the eligibility criteria. The mean total bioaerosol concentrations in the different areas of the hospitals were highest in the inpatient facilities (77 cfu/m3, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 55–108) compared with the restricted (13cfu/m3, 95\% CI: 10–15) and public areas (14 cfu/m3, 95\% CI: 10–19). Hospital areas with natural ventilation had the highest total bioaerosol concentrations (201 cfu/m3, 95\% CI: 135–300) compared with areas using conventional mechanical ventilation systems (20 cfu/m3, 95\% CI: 16–24). Hospital areas using sophisticated mechanical ventilation systems (such as increased air changes per hour, directional flow and filtration systems) had the lowest total bioaerosol concentrations (9 cfu/m3, 95\% CI: 7–13). Operating sophisticated mechanical ventilation systems in hospitals contributes to improved indoor air quality within hospitals, which assists in reducing the risk of airborne transmission of HAIs.},

About, 52\% of the classrooms presented a mean indoor CO2 concentration higher than 1000ppm. The specific experimental data have been compared against existing ventilation rates and carbon dioxide concentrations using published information from 287 classrooms of 182 naturally ventilated schools and 900 classrooms from 220 mechanically ventilated schools. The relation between the air flow rates and the corresponding indoor carbon dioxide is analysed and then compared to the existing data from naturally and mechanically ventilated schools. It is found that all three data sets present a CO2 concentration equal to 1000ppm for air flows around 8l/p/s. Specific adaptive actions to improve the indoor environmental quality have been recorded and the impact of indoor and ambient temperatures as well as of the carbon dioxide concentration on window opening is analysed in detail. A clear relation is found, between the indoor temperature at which the adapting action takes place and the resulting air flow rate. In parallel, a statistically significant relation between window opening and the indoor–outdoor temperature difference has been established.},

Therefore, in this pilot study, a surveillance activity based on the real-time monitoring of CO2 levels as a proxy of SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk, was conducted inside 9 schools (11 classrooms) located in Apulia Region (South of Italy) during the reopening of schools after the lockdown due to COVID-19 pandemic. More specifically, monitoring activities and data treatment were conducted to evaluate the initial scenario inside the classrooms (first stage of evaluation) and the potential improvements obtained by applying a detailed operating protocol of air ventilation based on specific actions and the simultaneous real time visualization of CO2 levels by non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) sensors (second stage of evaluation). Although, during the first evaluation stage, air ventilation through the opening of windows and doors was guaranteed, 6 (54\%) classrooms showed mean values of CO2 higher than 1000 ppm and all classrooms exceeded the recommended CO2 concentration limit value of 700 ppm. The development and implementation of tailored ventilation protocol including the real time visualization of CO2 levels allowed to depict better scenariosAn overall improvement of CO2 levels was indeed registered for all classrooms where teachers were compliant and helpful in the management of the air ventilation strategy. Therefore, this study reports the first evidence-based measures demonstrating that, with the exception of few environments affected by structural limits, the real-time visualization and monitoring of CO2 concentrations allowes effective air exchanges to be implemented and contributes to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Moreover, on the basis of the monitoring outcomes and in order to ensure adequate air ventilation in educational buildings, a 4 level-risk classification including specific corrective actions for each level was provided.},

While technical solutions to ensure adequate air exchange are crucial, this research focuses on teachers’ perceptions and practices that may also have important implications for achieving a safe classroom environment. We report on a (pre-pandemic) survey of 84 teachers across 11 California schools, exploring their perceptions of environmental quality in relation to monitored indoor environmental quality (IEQ) data from their classrooms. Teachers were not educated regarding mechanical ventilation. Errors in HVAC system installation and programming contributed to misunderstandings (because mechanical ventilation was often not performing as it should) and even occasionally made it possible for teachers to turn off the HVAC fan (to reduce noise). Teachers did not accurately perceive (in)sufficient ventilation; in fact, those in classrooms with poorer ventilation were more satisfied with IEQ, likely due to more temperature fluctuations when ventilation rates were higher combined with occupants’ tendency to conflate perceptions of air quality and temperature. We conclude that classroom CO2 monitoring and teacher education are vital to ensure that teachers feel safe in the classroom and empowered to protect the health of themselves and their students.},

	abstract = {In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, an increased risk of infection by virus-containing aerosols indoors is assumed. Especially in schools, the duration of stay is long and the number of people in the rooms is large, increasing the risk of infection. This problem particularly affects schools without pre-installed ventilation systems that are equipped with filters and/or operate with fresh air. Here, the aerosol concentration is reduced by natural ventilation. In this context, we are investigating the effect of large mobile air purifiers (AP) with HEPA filters on particle concentration and their suitability for classroom use in a primary school in Germany. The three tested APs differ significantly in their air outlet characteristics. Measurements of the number of particles, the particle size distribution, and the CO2 concentration were carried out in the classroom with students (April/May 2021) and with an aerosol generator without students. In this regard, the use of APs leads to a substantial reduction of aerosol particles in the considered particle size range of 0.178–17.78 µm. At the same time, the three APs are found to have differences in their particle decay rate, noise level, and flow velocity. In addition to the measurements, the effect of various influencing parameters on the potential inhaled particle dose was investigated using a calculation model. The parameters considered include the duration of stay, particle concentration in exhaled air, respiratory flow rate, virus lifetime, ventilation interval, ventilation efficiency, AP volumetric flow, as well as room size. Based on the resulting effect diagrams, significant recommendations can be derived for reducing the risk of infection from virus-laden aerosols. Finally, the measurements were compared to computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling, as such tools can aid the optimal placement and configuration of APs and can be used to study the effect of the spread of aerosols from a source in the classroom.},

Airborne route has been considered as a major transmission pathway, which can spread the disease over a longer distance and time. The viral loads in the respiratory tract of a virus carrier are typically below 109 RNA copies/mL and are related to the emission rate of pathogens. Most particles expelled during respiratory activities are smaller than 1–2 µm in diameter. Viral aerosols can remain infectious for hours under typical indoor conditions. Sunlight contributes greatly to the viability inactivation of SARS-CoV-2. The outbreaks in different scenarios are reviewed based on existing data. Most outbreaks were related to long-term care facilities, K-12 schools, restaurants, retail facilities, and offices. The Wells-Riley model for estimating the risk of airborne transmission is introduced, along with model parameters such as the quanta generation rate, virus-containing particle size distribution, and inactivation rate. The effectiveness of various IAQ control strategies for mitigating the airborne transmission risk is analyzed, including PPE, ventilation strategies, partitions, air cleaning, and disinfection technologies, and occupancy control strategies. Both benefits and costs should be considered in designing the control strategies.},

	abstract = {Background Elevated rates of tuberculosis in healthcare workers demonstrate the high rate of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) transmission in health facilities in high-burden settings. In the context of a project taking a whole systems approach to tuberculosis infection prevention and control (IPC), we aimed to evaluate the potential impact of conventional and novel IPC measures on Mtb transmission to patients and other clinic attendees.
Methods An individual-based model of patient movements through clinics, ventilation in waiting areas, and Mtb transmission was developed, and parameterised using empirical data from eight clinics in two provinces in South Africa. Seven interventions—codeveloped with health professionals and policy-makers—were simulated: (1) queue management systems with outdoor waiting areas, (2) ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) systems, (3) appointment systems, (4) opening windows and doors, (5) surgical mask wearing by clinic attendees, (6) simple clinic retrofits and (7) increased coverage of long antiretroviral therapy prescriptions and community medicine collection points through the Central Chronic Medicine Dispensing and Distribution (CCMDD) service.
Results In the model, (1) outdoor waiting areas reduced the transmission to clinic attendees by 83\% (IQR 76\%–88\%), (2) UVGI by 77\% (IQR 64\%–85\%), (3) appointment systems by 62\% (IQR 45\%–75\%), (4) opening windows and doors by 55\% (IQR 25\%–72\%), (5) masks by 47\% (IQR 42\%–50\%), (6) clinic retrofits by 45\% (IQR 16\%–64\%) and (7) increasing the coverage of CCMDD by 22\% (IQR 12\%–32\%).
Conclusions The majority of the interventions achieved median reductions in the rate of transmission to clinic attendees of at least 45\%, meaning that a range of highly effective intervention options are available, that can be tailored to the local context. Measures that are not traditionally considered to be IPC interventions, such as appointment systems, may be as effective as more traditional IPC measures, such as mask wearing.},

While the “REDCap Consortium” model represents only one example of how to build and disseminate a software platform, lessons learned from our approach may assist other research institutions seeking to build and disseminate innovative technologies.},

	abstract = {Background School-level infection control measures in Germany during the early Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic differed across the 16 federal states and lacked a dependable evidence base, with available evidence limited to regional data restricted to short phases of the pandemic. This study aimed to assess the (a) infection risks in students and staff; (b) transmission risks and routes in schools; (c) effects of school-level infection control measures on school and population infection dynamics; and (d) contribution of contacts in schools to population cases. Methods and findings For this retrospective observational study, we used German federal state (NUTS-2) and county (NUTS-3) data from public health and education agencies from March 2020 to April 2022. We assessed (a) infection risk as cumulative risk and crude risk ratios and (b) secondary attack rates (SARs) with 95\% confidence interval (CI). We used (c) multiple regression analysis for the effects of infection control measures such as reduced attendance, mask mandates, and vaccination coverage as absolute reduction in case incidence per 100,000 inhabitants per 14 days and in percentage relative to the population, and (d) infection dynamic modelling to determine the percentage contribution of school contacts to population cases. We included (a) nationwide NUTS-2 data from calendar weeks (W) 46-50/2020 and W08/2021-W15/2022 with 3,521,964 cases in students and 329,283 in teachers; (b) NUTS-3 data from W09-25/2021 with 85,788 student and 9,427 teacher cases; and (c) detailed data from 5 NUTS-3 regions from W09/2020 to W27/2021 with 12,814 cases (39\% male, 37\% female; median age 14, range 5 to 63), 43,238 contacts and 4,165 secondary cases for students (for teachers, 14,801 [22\% male, 50\% female; median age 39, range 16 to 75], 5,893 and 472). Infection risk (a) for students and teachers was higher than the population risk in all phases of normal presence class and highest in the early 2022 omicron wave with 30.6\% (95\% CI 30.5\% to 32.6\%) of students and 32.7\% (95\% CI 32.6\% to 32.8\%) of teachers infected in Germany. SARs (b) for students and staff were below 5\% in schools throughout the study period, while SARs in households more than doubled from 13.8\% (95\% CI 10.6\% to 17.6\%) W21-39/2020 to 28.7\% (95\% CI 27\% to 30.4\%) in W08-23/2021 for students and 10.9\% (95\% CI 7\% to 16.5\%) to 32.7\% (95\% CI 28.2\% to 37.6\%) for staff. Most contacts were reported for schools, yet most secondary cases originated in households. In schools, staff predominantly infected staff. Mandatory surgical mask wearing during class in all schools was associated with a reduction in the case incidence of students and teachers (c), by 56/100,000 persons per 14 days (students: 95\% CI 47.7 to 63.4; teachers: 95\% CI 39.6 to 71.6; p {\textless} 0.001) and by 29.8\% (95\% CI 25\% to 35\%, p {\textless} 0.001) and 24.3\% (95\% CI 13\% to 36\%, p {\textless} 0.001) relative to the population, respectively, as were reduced attendance and higher vaccination coverage. The contribution of contacts in schools to population cases (d) was 2\% to 20\%, lowest during school closures/vacation and peaked during normal presence class intervals, with the overall peak early during the omicron wave. Limitations include underdetection, misclassification of contacts, interviewer/interviewee dependence of contact-tracing, and lack of individual-level confounding factors in aggregate data regression analysis. Conclusion In this study, we observed that open schools under hygiene measures and testing strategies contributed up to 20\% of population infections during the omicron wave early 2022, and as little as 2\% during vacations/school closures; about a third of students and teachers were infected during the omicron wave in early 2022 in Germany. Mandatory mask wearing during class in all school types and reduced attendance models were associated with a reduced infection risk in schools.},
